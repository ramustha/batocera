		<name>Crash Bandicoot : The Wrath of Cortex</name>
		<desc>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).

The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</desc>

		<path>./Bully (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Bully</name>
		<desc>Bully is a subtle sandbox game set in a school environment. The player takes control of teenage rebel James "Jimmy" Hopkins, who from the opening cutscene is revealed to be a difficult student with a disruptive background. The game concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items.

School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.</desc>

		<name>Mafia</name>
		<desc>Mafia is set in the 1930s, between the fall of 1930 through to the end of 1938, during the later part of Prohibition, which ended in 1933. The game is set in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven (loosely based on New York City and Chicago of the same time period).

The player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas "Tommy" Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver and enforcer for the Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.

Through the events of the game's story, Tommy begins to rise through the ranks of the Salieri family, which is currently battling the competing Morello family, led by the sharply-dressed Don Morello. Eventually becoming disillusioned by his life of crime and violence, Tommy arranges to meet a detective (Detective Norman) in order to tell him his story, to be given witness protection, and to aid the detective in the destruction of the Salieri crime family. The 'Intermezzo' chapters of the game depict Tommy sitting in a cafe with the detective, relating his life story and giving out important pieces of information at the same time.</desc>

		<desc>CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in Identicon Corporation, based in Hong Kong, is discovered and captured. Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.

The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.</desc>

Unlike the previous three titles in the series, this game strays from just simply ATV's in it's roster of vehicles. Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.</desc>

		<name>Burnout</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

The more cars you take out, damage you inflict, the more events and cars you can unlock. Burnout 3 also has a "crash" mode which puts your vehicle at a variety of traffic junctions jam-packed with moving vehicles and pickups to see just how much monetary damage you can inflict.

Burnout 3: Takedown continues the racing series with more cars, more tracks, a more detailed crash engine, and a multitude of new gameplay modes for single players, multiple players on one system, and online play.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Revenge</name>
		<desc>In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many "Crash Dollars" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as "traffic checking", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a "checked" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.</desc>

		<desc>Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations.  Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals.

Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for.  Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes.  Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you're going.  Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you.  Then take the shot!

Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online.  Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices!

Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit.  Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don't forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy.

Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions.  Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 puts the player in the shoes of Flint Abrahams, a famous hunter who travels around the world in search of hunting challenges. The player spends much time exploring the wilderness looking for traces of prey. Because they can be hard to make out, a Hunter's Sense is included to reduce the world to grayscales and make animals stand out. The game however maintains an arcade approach and lets the player shoot everything in his way, without regard for a patient approach.

The game's Career mode has timed levels forcing quick gameplay, and the different stages are set all around the world. When facing larger animals such as bear or lions, a Hand-to-Claw Combat mode is often triggered automatically to fend them off through a number of quick time event key presses. Another option is the Adrenaline mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills.

Different types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to kill animals ? tranquillizing them is sufficient.</desc>

As in the home computer original, PlayStation 2 players experience the game through three different campaigns, which have them taking the roles of an American, British, and Russian soldier in turn.
 Each campaign is designed to offer a distinct perspective, as the player's characters and their squad mates participate in historically inspired battles across four different continents. The Call of Duty series is noted for its historical accuracy and cross-cultural perspectives, its interactive environments, and its cinematically styled approach to story-telling. The PC original was developed by Infinity Ward, a team comprising several designers who had worked on the successful Medal of Honor series. The Finest Hour console versions of Call of Duty are the first games from developer Spark Unlimited.</desc>

This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company.

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3</name>
		<desc>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.
 They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.
 Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3 : Xtreme Legends</name>
		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion to Dynasty Warriors 3. In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.

The gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as "Musou Mode"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).

The difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original.  There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.</desc>

Fourth in its series, this game's deep storyline incorporates a host of new features, character depth and insight into the turbulent events of the Three Kingdoms era. Can you succeed as a warrior of honor  and loyalty in the face of adversity? Your obligations to lords and allies guide your path as you fight to unify a divided empire.</desc>

Burnout Dominator is the second spin-off game in the Burnout series and sixth overall. It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing "reckless skill-based" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other.
This is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games, and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the "Crash Mode". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Games are listed as "the makers of this game" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.</desc>

Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.</desc>

		<desc>God of War is an action-oriented adventure game with a strong focus on fast-paced combat. Players take control of Kratos, a mystically powerful hero in the ancient Greece of classic mythology. Kratos can perform super-human leaps, agile dodges, and magically enhanced combo attacks, which all flow together in a stream of intense engagement. The fast-paced, over-the-top fighting, combined with the tense environments and computer-directed camera angles, give gameplay the feel of combat-adventures such as Devil May Cry or Otogi.
 Unlike those earlier blends of survival-horror presentation and combat-minded control schemes, however, God of War is set in a world more immediately familiar to all fans of western fantasy. The ultimate goal of Kratos is a conclusive confrontation with Ares -- the god of war himself -- but the hero must face a deadly succession of monsters and villains from Greek mythology as he pursues this end. The Hydra, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Minotaur, and other legendary creatures will all have their chances to destroy Kratos before he meets his final destiny.</desc>

 More of a healthy, Aerosmith-themed expansion of Guitar Hero III than a completely new entry in the series, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith nevertheless offers more than 40 new rock songs to which gamers can shred. The track list is heavy with Aerosmith classics like "Dream On," "Sweet Emotion," and "Rag Doll," but the game also features songs from groups that have influenced or toured with the band, including Mott the Hoople, New York Dolls, and The Black Crowes.</desc>

The whole game takes place in "flashbacks", where 47 is reminiscing about past missions, some of which were previously seen in Hitman: Codename 47, the first game from the Hitman series.

Gameplay in Hitman: Contracts is similar to the previous installments. Your job will be to complete several missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from "Mass Murderer" up to the coveted "Silent Assassin". If you manage to complete a mission with a "Silent Assassin" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 5 : Empires</name>
		<desc>Set in ancient China, Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires brings the Empire mode to the latest DW game, while the basic hack &amp; slash, button mashing gameplay remains the same.

The Empire mode adds a strategy overlay to the basic game, with a map of 25 areas to conquer. Each turn consists of two parts: empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other.

There is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.</desc>

		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a minor expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5. This game was released on November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console.

Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and Legend Mode.

Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain health and increase stats temporarily.

In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be "protected" by a chosen officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the player's defection.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy X</name>
		<desc>Square's acclaimed role-playing series makes its PlayStation 2 debut with Final Fantasy X. Players assume the role of Tidus, an athletic teenager who witnessed the destruction of his home city by an evil entity named Sin. While his life was spared, Tidus' contact with Sin opened a portal through time. Some 1,000 years have passed since the encounter, and Tidus now finds himself in a strange land with unfamiliar faces. As Tidus struggles to find a way back home, he will meet a variety of characters, including Yuna, a girl faced with the daunting task of defeating Sin.
 Final Fantasy X features a number of new features over previous installments. Backgrounds and characters are rendered entirely in 3D, with real-time facial expressions visible on each character. When characters are surprised, for example, they will raise their eyebrows or open their mouths in astonishment. For the first time in the series, dialogue has been recorded using professional voice actors. The U.S. version features voices in English, with optional English subtitles selectable from the menu screen.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy X-2</name>
		<desc>The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war.

The story begins as Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story?including characterization and background details?are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.</desc>

		<desc>GT4 continues in its predecessors' footsteps by offering an extremely large list of cars; the PAL version features 721 cars from 80 manufacturers. 

Players now accumulate points by winning races in the normal first-person driving mode, called A-Spec mode. Each race event can yield up to a maximum of 200 A-Spec points. Generally, a win using a car with less of an advantage over the AI opponents is worth more points. Points can only be won once, so to win further points from a previously-won event, it must be re-won using a car with less of an advantage over the AI. There are also the 34 Missions which can yield 250 points each. Despite this, A-Spec points are experience points, not money.</desc>

The leader of the organization for whom he used to work, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention upon his organization's criminal activities. To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly "promotes" Tommy and sends him to Vice City to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[7] During Tommy's first meeting with the drug dealers, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards, Harry and Lee, and the cocaine dealer. There is another survivor, the pilot of the dealer's helicopter, who flies off and escapes. Tommy narrowly escapes with his life, but he loses both the Forelli's money and the cocaine.</desc>

While running from the scene, Catalina turns to him and utters, "Sorry, babe, I'm an ambitious girl and you ... you're just small-time". She shoots him and leaves him to die in an alley; the accomplice is also seen lying nearby. It soon becomes apparent that the player character has survived but has been arrested and subsequently found guilty and sentenced to jail. While he is being transferred, an attack on the police convoy aimed at kidnapping an unrelated prisoner sets him free.</desc>

		<name>Guitar Hero : Aerosmith</name>
		<desc>One of Activision's most successful franchises joins forces with one of rock's most enduring bands in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. The series, known for making gamers feel like rock stars, first put real rock stars into games with the inclusion of guitar gods Slash and Tom Morello as boss characters in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Guitar Hero: Aerosmith lets players follow the legendary Boston-based quintet's ascension from the tiny Nipmuc High School auditorium to center stage at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show.
 More of a healthy, Aerosmith-themed expansion of Guitar Hero III than a completely new entry in the series, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith nevertheless offers more than 40 new rock songs to which gamers can shred. The track list is heavy with Aerosmith classics like "Dream On," "Sweet Emotion," and "Rag Doll," but the game also features songs from groups that have influenced or toured with the band, including Mott the Hoople, New York Dolls, and The Black Crowes.</desc>

The game's set list now supports four players in a full band set-up (introduced to the Guitar Hero series in  World Tour), an 8-player battle of the bands setup, and all songs are now original recordings from the genuine artists and are all playable in the Quick Play mode without the need to complete the career first.

Slight changes have also been made to the gameplay mechanics, including the addition of slider notes (again from World Tour) and the inclusion of the Expert+ difficulty setting for drums, which is carried over from Guitar Hero: Metallica.</desc>

This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Capcom's three-on-three arcade game, featuring popular characters from previous action, shooting, and fighting titles, comes to the PS2 with this release of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Over 50 characters are available to fight as or against, two-dozen of which are initially playable. Each combatant offers a variety of aerial maneuvers, special attacks, and projectile blasts as players attempt to defeat their opponent's team.
 Rather than having all three characters fight on the screen at once, players swap fighters in and out of the match at any time, even for a single attack on an opponent. The remaining two characters rest on the sidelines until called upon to assist. In addition to a health bar, each fighter has a separate meter used for Hyper Combo attacks that can be powered-up to five increasingly destructive levels.
 Besides directly switching characters during a fight, players can press one of two assist buttons to have one of their teammates perform a pre-selected attack or defensive maneuver. If an opponent has unleashed an aerial attack, for example, pressing the assist button might have the second or third character enter the screen to perform an anti-air maneuver, thus leaving the primary fighter free from harm.</desc>

		<desc>A stealth action video game directed by Hideo Kojima, developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the sixth canonical game in the Metal Gear series and the sequel to Metal Gear Solid. The story revolves around a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by terrorists calling themselves the "Sons of Liberty." They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States, and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change rapidly, as the heroes discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater</name>
		<desc>Hideo Kojima's critically acclaimed "tactical espionage action" series returns to PlayStation 2 in the anticipated follow-up to 2001's Sons of Liberty. Instead of slinking around futuristic installations, knocking on metal to distract guards, or crawling underneath a cardboard box, players are given a whole new Snake to wrangle. Drawing its inspiration from films like First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II, Snake Eater drops players in the middle of a thick jungle teeming with wildlife and, of course, terrorists.
 Heavily armed enemies dressed in camouflage gear will patrol the dense forests, waterfalls, and surrounding areas, so players will be able to climb trees, fire pistols while hanging down from branches, and crawl through hollowed out logs to stalk their prey. Along the way, Snake will have to find sustenance by catching fish or other wildlife, while being mindful of natural hazards such hornets nests, cliffs, and rapids. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was first revealed in a 12-minute preview displayed at 2003's E3 in Los Angeles, California.</desc>

		<desc>The fifth Mortal Kombat fighting game is the first to be designed exclusively for home consoles instead of the arcades. The game features a new 3D engine to support the familiar combination of weapon and hand-to-hand combat, but moves are now based on real-life martial arts styles, such as Crane, Snake, Tai Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, Tang Soo Doo, and more. Fighting styles can be switched at any time during a match, and the damage a character receives will be visible on his or her face, body, clothing, or movements.



 Returning characters from the best-selling series include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Cyrax, Jax, Raiden, Sonya, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and Reptile. Characters making their debut in Deadly Alliance include a female counterpart for Sub-Zero, a blind samurai, and a masked tribal warrior. Arenas take place in fully 3D environments, fraught with spiked pits, pools of acid, and other deadly hazards. New special moves and gruesome fatalities will also be included as the franchise makes its debut on the next-generation systems.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the on the 1999 coin-op Namco 500cc GP, Moto GP brings motorcycle racing to the PS2, complete with single race, multiplayer, time trial and season modes. Race 125, 250 and 500cc bikes on a variety of real-life international courses in France, Germany, Japan and other countries around the world. And even though it's based on an arcade game, realism hasn't been forgotten, as realistic breaking and turning maneuvers are necessary for success.


 All of the riders from the MotoGP motorcycle championship are here to choose from, including hall of fame riders. As well as the Vs. and Arcade modes, there is also a challenge mode where, much like Gran Turismo's license mode, you must complete certain challenges to unlock new tracks, riders and pictures. These challenges range from beating the clock, to winning certain events in the arcade mode.</desc>

		<desc>Namco, the genius company behind Tekken and Ridge Racer, has also proved itself a dab-hand at the motorcycle racing game. Early 2001, the arcade giant released Moto GP for PlayStation 2, and its runaway success quickly led to the research of a sequel. After considerable development time, Namco return with the second instalment.
 Moto GP 2 players can expect a glut of updates. New season statistics have naturally been included, and there are now 10 circuits to race on, all of which are genuine true-to-life tracks, bustling with interactivity. The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.</desc>

Different levels of difficulty relating to the realism of the bikes handling, performance and brake assistance are offered to cater for both novice and more experienced players. All the usual setup options are available to tune your bike for each track. The game also features the ability for up to eight players to take part in an online race.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay is based upon rival street racing crews. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to conquer territories and face off against bosses to conquer districts.</desc>

Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi, but manage to seal the demon away.
 In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend and wants to prove it false; Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads for her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.</desc>

You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. 

With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</desc>

		<name>Ratchet &amp; Clank</name>
		<desc>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.

Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a "backdrop"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person.

The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</desc>

The PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil -- CODE: Veronica X is similar to the original Dreamcast release in nearly every relevant way though it contains additional cut-scenes.
 Resident Evil -- CODE: Veronica X picks up where the PlayStation's Resident Evil 2 left off, in Raccoon City. There, the Umbrella Corporation performed scientific experiments that went wrong. The result of their experiments was a virus that led to the creation of a huge number of zombies as well as a variety of other creatures bent on a path of death and destruction. As members of S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad), players did the best they could to stop the Umbrella Corp.'s madness, but ultimately Raccoon City and all of its inhabitants were wiped out.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of Rome</name>
		<desc>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3]
Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use special moves such as "Red Volcano"â€”a move used to slice enemies in halfâ€” to please the crowds.[2] As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3]
In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone.[3]</desc>

Developed by the studio that created the PS2's critically acclaimed Ico, Shadow of the Colossus is another fantasy-themed puzzle adventure that's light on dialog and heavy on beautifully expressive environments.
 Players take the role of a young knight who sets out to rescue his sleeping-beauty princess from a magic-induced state of suspended animation. To do so, he'll need to defeat the 16 Colossi -- landscape-sized enemies so enormous that they can only be conquered by exploring them, platform-game style, to discover their weaknesses. Against some Colossi, the hero may ride his faithful steed alongside the monster, galloping at full speed just to keep up with its mile-long strides. Other Colossi require the player to actually climb aboard, and crawl, run, and leap across their massive forms to find the hidden vulnerability that can be used to bring them down.</desc>

Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience.

They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. "They who reach Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard."

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.

Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.

As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill.</desc>

Three years later, a mysterious letter arrives from Mary, beckoning him to return to their sanctuary of memories, the dark realm of Silent Hill. You must guide James through all-new environments and creepy new areas closed off in the original game. Real-time weather effects, fog, morphing, and shadows set the stage for heart-stopping frights. Be brave as you journey to uncover the truth.

Director's Cut is an updated version of Silent Hill 2. It contains all of the content of the original version and adds several pieces of new content. The most significant is a new short scenario called Born from a Wish, where players take control of Maria from her first moments right up to where she first appears in the main game. Also included is a sixth ending to the main scenario and a minor feature that allows the player to turn off the graphical effect, which makes the game look like it was shot on cheap film stock.</desc>

The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those who drink it.

Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and find out where they're headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down villains before they get away.

Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts.

All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).

The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</desc>

		<name>Sly 2 : Band of Thieves</name>
		<desc>Thief and raccoon Sly Cooper returns in a new cel-shaded platforming adventure wherein he forms a band of thieves with Bentley the turtle and Murray the purple, hippo-like creature, which each have their own role within the game.

Sly is the fastest, most agile member of the band of thieves and still is the character you play with the most. But certain missions require the special abilities of Bentley, who is smart and can drop bombs, as well shoot enemies from a distance. Other missions require the muscles of Murray, who can lift nearly everything, including enemies.

The main goal of the game is the retrieval of a number of clockwork pieces from different locations around the world. Each theft has to be prepared with a number of sub-missions which have to be completed before the 'real thing' can begin.</desc>

Generally, there are the bonuses "Time" (clear level in a set time), "Perfect" (Not take damage/detected) and "Style" (use as many combos as possible). Other level-specific ones are "Secrets" (Uncover a secret area), "Combat" (Defeat all enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on completing these tasks.</desc>

All six characters suddenly find themselves targeted by an enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic/symbiote combination foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger.

The game's combat system is heavily concentrated on lightsaber combat. Each of the playable characters (with the exception of the IG-100 Magnaguard) is equipped with at least one lightsaber. There are three basic attacks: Fast attacks which do the least amount of damage, Strong Attacks which do more damage but are slower to execute, and the slowest but strongest Critical Attacks. These attacks can be mixed to create combination attacks. Attacks can also be charged up for greater strength. One feature of the game is called a Saber Lock - a sequence in which the player's character clashes swords with an opponent. Other offensive maneuvers are also available, including grapples, jumps and flying kicks.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the events of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, there are three main characters: Rhys Dallows, Vana Sage, and Nym, each with their own perspectives on the events surrounding the battle for Naboo. Each character has their own ships for you to fly, with both positives and negatives attached, but either way you must stop the Trade Federation and their plans to destroy the peaceful planet.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : Super Bombad Racing</name>
		<desc>It's Star Wars like you have never seen it before. Each character, from Episode 1, looks more like something from a Japanese animation.

While flying around the many familiar landscapes (Tatooine, the underwater village Otoh Gunga and a driod control ship in orbit over Naboo) your character can use the many weapons and power-ups that litter the tracks, as well as using moves that only they can perform. For example. Jar-Jar uses his tongue to grab onto anyone in front of him, so he can catch up, while Darth Maul throws his double edged lightsaber as a very deadly weapon.

Also keep an eye out for monsters and items that get in the way on the track. Some may be useful, others very annoying.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : The Clone Wars</name>
		<desc>Beginning where Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones left off, you must take control of either Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu or Obi-Wan Kenobi and lead the Republic Army against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

The Clone Wars picks up with Mace Windu escorting the Jedi ambush to the Geonosis arena, which leads to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars. After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var. After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var. They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon. Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!

The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.</desc>

Not willing to give up, Heihachi searches for his grandson, Jin Kazama, who does possess the Devil Gene, with Heihachi learning that the body of his son, Kazuya (who also has the Devil Gene and died twenty years ago) is stored in the labs of the Mishima Zaibatsu's main business rival, G Corporation.</desc>

		<desc>Loved across the world for its amazing characters, explosive graphics and lightning-fast gameplay, Tekken 5 promises to deliver the next generation of blistered fingers and bleary eyes as it brings players the ultimate, most visually stunning fighting experience ever seen in a Tekken game.
Tekken 5 brings back the popular cast of characters from the previous games along with three new characters for a total of 20 default characters to start, with even more to unlock as you progress in the game. The game allows players to use fight money to customize their character with various accessories such as hats, glasses and an assortment of different costumes. Each of the new characters is equipped with a variety of deadly techniques, and the returning characters have been updated with new moves and combos. New to Tekken 5 is a bonus action adventure game that unfolds a side story to the action-packed fighting sequences.
After the completion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, a fierce battle between father and son unfolded at Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerges as the victor in this battle and continues to defeat Heihachi, his grandfather - but spares both Kazuya and Heihachi's lives in honour of his mother who loved peace. Soon after Jin's departure, a swarm of Jacks arrive at Honmaru and begin to attack Heihachi and Kazuya - and in order to escape, Kazuya thrusts Heihachi into the swarm of Jacks. A great explosion destroys Honmaru, and a man watching from afar reports, "Heihachi Mishima is dead." While many presume the death of Heihachi Mishima will end the reign of Mishima Zaibatsu, an announcement is made for the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament, with an unknown replacement to Heihachi leading the organization. The fight begins once again.</desc>

		<name>Tekken's Nina Williams in : Death by Degrees</name>
		<desc>Nina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team which is attempting to infiltrate "Kometa," a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the "Amphitrite," a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa.

The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.

Once the game is completed, "Anna Mode" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks "Tekken 2 Nina", which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the Tekken title, in low resolution.</desc>

Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler's signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the "Macho Man" Randy Savage.

The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</desc>

One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.

The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.</desc>

The game features real-life attributes of strength, submission, technique, speed and stamina for each wrestler. These new attributes allow players to wear down their opponents and take advantage of each Superstar's unique abilities and extensive move sets, expanding the amount of stances to sixteen (as opposed to four in the previous game).

Players can create, play and develop their own superstar through various storylines staged by the WWE. New match types and modes are available as well. Players can track their progress with seasonal stats, earn money to build up superstar abilities, and unlock hidden features.</desc>

		<desc>The control system of the game is heavily influenced by other popular fighting titles, such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, or Darkstalkers. The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering.

The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.

While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.</desc>

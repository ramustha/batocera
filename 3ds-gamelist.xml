		<name>Harvest Moon: The Tale of Two Towns</name>
		<desc>Long ago the towns of Bluebell and Konohana were friendly neighbors, joined together by a tunnel underneath the mountain that separates the towns. Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where their cooking conflict continues four times per season. 

As a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor's story, hear about each town, and then decide where you want to start your new farm life.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D</name>
		<desc>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.

In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.

The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.

Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.

The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</desc>

		<name>Ace Combat : Assault Horizon Legacy</name>
		<desc>Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy is a flight-sim / arcade fighter combat action game.  The game is typically played in a 3rd-Person, behind the aircraft, or 1st-Person, inside the cockpit view.  It features series mainstays such as numerous selectable aircraft and the ability to purchase parts and weapons to customize the fighters.  Where Assault Horizon Legacy sets itself apart from current console versions of Assault Horizon in that the gameplay is tipped more in favor of the arcade-style action of the early games in the series rather than focusing on flight-sim characteristics.  Also different from the console versions of Assault Horizon is that this entry takes place in the fictional universe of the older games in the series, rather than real-world locations.</desc>

		<desc>Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era will provide high-kicking action in glorious, portable 3D in an all new story setting.

In this latest videogame action adventure in the long running and celebrated series, Naruto is presented for the very first time in 3D, with dynamic camera twists and turns taking full advantage of the new Nintendo handheld's hardware capabilities. Naruto is available from the outset as a selectable character, with rival Sasuke un-lockable during the course of gameplay. A supporting cast of ten 'assist' characters, three of which can be taken along per chapter, offers a different dynamic to gameplay, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat.

Naruto fans will be able to engage in a bespoke storyline based on the last events of the manga and animation series, featuring an all new female ninja character, Malice. The mysterious Five Kages, will also make their first videogame appearance in an adventure which spans nine different locations, with secret items and stages aplenty to be unlocked along the way.

Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era on 3DS also incorporates the lead character's 'Sage Mode', in which Naruto transforms into a significantly more powerful version of himself once his special gauge is charged to maximum. The game will make use of the 3DS' motion controls, in situations such as avoiding certain attacks and during boss fights.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</name>
		<desc>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is not a typical Resident Evil title.  It handily shrugs off the horror atmosphere of past titles for horror-themed action and combat.  The Mercenaries 3D is essentially a full game version of the now classic Mercenaries mode found in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5.

Gameplay

The Mercenaries 3 plays almost exactly like the Mercenaries modes of it's console brethren.  It is an action-oriented title where players can choose any of eight playable characters to shoot, explode, and melee their way through swarms of marauding enemies.  The game is viewed from the over-the-shoulder style of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, switching to a zoomed view when targeting enemies.  The zoomed view can be played in either third or first-person.  

The gameplay is straightforward and simple:  Kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit, or kill a required number of enemies before time runs out.  Stages have individual settings, such as all being done in a set time limit, having a time limit that can be extended, defeating waves of enemies, or defeating a boss character.  All enemies and stages are taken from and inspired by  Resident Evil 4 and 5.  There are thirty individual missions in all.

Features

The game features a variety of features to add some depth to the original experience.  Most notable is the wide variety of Skills that can be applied to each character and upgraded.  Each character can carry up to three different skills at one time, and they gain experience and improve as the game is played with them equipped.  Skills such as being resistant to death, reloading guns faster, better use of medical supplies, and the like are peppered throughout the game.  These are unlocked by playing through the regular game and accomplishing various tasks, such as building combos with kills.

There are also a wide variety of medals that can be earned through the game for completing various tasks.  There are fifty medals that can be earned which range from simple "Clear all Missions for Level 1" to more challenge-focused elements like "Kill 3 enemies with 1 hand grenade" or "Clear a mission without ever missing a shot."

There is a level of weapon customization and there are alternate costumes for all the usable characters as well.  Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is also playable in co-op both online and in local play.

Resident Evil: Revelations

Arguably the biggest added feature to the game is that is comes with a playable demo of the next main-line game for the Resident Evil series, which is called Resident Evil: Revelations and is geared towards the classic survival horror style of the franchise.  The demo is brief, but intended to give players an idea that Capcom is interested in successfully combining the survival horror aspects of the original games with the refined gameplay from modern titles.  The demo lasts for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the player.</desc>

		<desc>October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.

However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.

August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.

August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.</desc>

		<desc>Super Mario 3D Land is a platform game that has been described by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a "3D Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game." As such, Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side-scrolling Mario titles, such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world Mario titles, such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions. Similar to the classic side-scrolling Mario games, the objective of each level is to reach and grab the "Goal Pole" located at the end of the course before the time limit expires. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar health system to those games, in which Mario shrinks upon taking damage from enemies or hazards, and damage while as "Small Mario" results in losing a life.</desc>

In addition there are Grand Prix weekends and three-lap sprints. Grand Prix events are split up in practice runs, qualifying sessions and the main races themselves. There are driving aids (including determining the race distance), weather effects, fuel and tires options, and it includes the KERS and DRS systems from the main version.

Unique to the handheld versions is a number of mini-game challenges such as checkpoints races, overtaking, autocross-style slaloms or racing in specific situations such as the last two laps of a race in the rain with the wrong tires equipped. They are organized in tiers with a bonus one at the end. The performance in these challenges is ranked with a letter. The game can be played online and for the 3DS StreetPass is used to unlock rival ghosts. Both versions support multiplayer, local as well as online, in head-to-head time trails or in a full Grand Prix. On the Vita the front touch screen is used to change the camera and the rear touch pad can be used as an optional substitute for actions such as braking and throttling.

Differences from the console version include downgraded graphics, a simplified damage model and certain animated sequences that have been cut.</desc>

Most levels also take place in flight-mode, where players need to carry out several missions e.g. defeating an army of vulture droids. Each level is split into 3 acts (which are then available to play separately as part of Free Play mode).</desc>

		<name>Harvest Moon: The Tale of Two Towns</name>
		<desc>Long ago the towns of Bluebell and Konohana were friendly neighbors, joined together by a tunnel underneath the mountain that separates the towns. Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where their cooking conflict continues four times per season. 

As a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor's story, hear about each town, and then decide where you want to start your new farm life.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D</name>
		<desc>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.

In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.

The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.

Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.

The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</desc>

Where Assault Horizon Legacy sets itself apart from current console versions of Assault Horizon in that the gameplay is tipped more in favor of the arcade-style action of the early games in the series rather than focusing on flight-sim characteristics.  Also different from the console versions of Assault Horizon is that this entry takes place in the fictional universe of the older games in the series, rather than real-world locations.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon - Shadow Wars</name>
		<desc>Shadow Wars involves a behind-the-scenes plot by "ultranationalist" conspirators to revert Russia back to the days of the Iron Curtain, Communism, and the Cold War. A large part of the plot involves the Russian conspirators meddling in the affairs of neighboring countries, wherein the Ghost Recon team is dispatched to clear things up. There are six characters acting as individual units similar to Nintendo's own Fire Emblem series, each with special abilities. The six classes are Commando, Gunner, Sniper, Recon, Engineer, and Medic. Players must learn to use each strategically to survive missions. Missions also tend to have multiple objectives, and difficulties may be selected prior to engaging each stage.</desc>

		<name>Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era</name>
		<desc>Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era will provide high-kicking action in glorious, portable 3D in an all new story setting.

In this latest videogame action adventure in the long running and celebrated series, Naruto is presented for the very first time in 3D, with dynamic camera twists and turns taking full advantage of the new Nintendo handheld's hardware capabilities. Naruto is available from the outset as a selectable character, with rival Sasuke un-lockable during the course of gameplay. A supporting cast of ten 'assist' characters, three of which can be taken along per chapter, offers a different dynamic to gameplay, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat.

Naruto fans will be able to engage in a bespoke storyline based on the last events of the manga and animation series, featuring an all new female ninja character, Malice. The mysterious Five Kages, will also make their first videogame appearance in an adventure which spans nine different locations, with secret items and stages aplenty to be unlocked along the way.

Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era on 3DS also incorporates the lead character's 'Sage Mode', in which Naruto transforms into a significantly more powerful version of himself once his special gauge is charged to maximum. The game will make use of the 3DS' motion controls, in situations such as avoiding certain attacks and during boss fights.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</name>
		<desc>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is not a typical Resident Evil title.  It handily shrugs off the horror atmosphere of past titles for horror-themed action and combat.  The Mercenaries 3D is essentially a full game version of the now classic Mercenaries mode found in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5.

Gameplay

The Mercenaries 3 plays almost exactly like the Mercenaries modes of it's console brethren.  It is an action-oriented title where players can choose any of eight playable characters to shoot, explode, and melee their way through swarms of marauding enemies.  The game is viewed from the over-the-shoulder style of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, switching to a zoomed view when targeting enemies.  The zoomed view can be played in either third or first-person.  

The gameplay is straightforward and simple:  Kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit, or kill a required number of enemies before time runs out.  Stages have individual settings, such as all being done in a set time limit, having a time limit that can be extended, defeating waves of enemies, or defeating a boss character.  All enemies and stages are taken from and inspired by  Resident Evil 4 and 5.  There are thirty individual missions in all.

Features

The game features a variety of features to add some depth to the original experience.  Most notable is the wide variety of Skills that can be applied to each character and upgraded.  Each character can carry up to three different skills at one time, and they gain experience and improve as the game is played with them equipped.  Skills such as being resistant to death, reloading guns faster, better use of medical supplies, and the like are peppered throughout the game.  These are unlocked by playing through the regular game and accomplishing various tasks, such as building combos with kills.

There are also a wide variety of medals that can be earned through the game for completing various tasks.  There are fifty medals that can be earned which range from simple "Clear all Missions for Level 1" to more challenge-focused elements like "Kill 3 enemies with 1 hand grenade" or "Clear a mission without ever missing a shot."

There is a level of weapon customization and there are alternate costumes for all the usable characters as well.  Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is also playable in co-op both online and in local play.

Resident Evil: Revelations

Arguably the biggest added feature to the game is that is comes with a playable demo of the next main-line game for the Resident Evil series, which is called Resident Evil: Revelations and is geared towards the classic survival horror style of the franchise.  The demo is brief, but intended to give players an idea that Capcom is interested in successfully combining the survival horror aspects of the original games with the refined gameplay from modern titles.  The demo lasts for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the player.</desc>

		<desc>October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.

However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.

August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.

August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.</desc>

As such, Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side-scrolling Mario titles, such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world Mario titles, such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions. Similar to the classic side-scrolling Mario games, the objective of each level is to reach and grab the "Goal Pole" located at the end of the course before the time limit expires. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar health system to those games, in which Mario shrinks upon taking damage from enemies or hazards, and damage while as "Small Mario" results in losing a life.</desc>

In addition there are Grand Prix weekends and three-lap sprints. Grand Prix events are split up in practice runs, qualifying sessions and the main races themselves. There are driving aids (including determining the race distance), weather effects, fuel and tires options, and it includes the KERS and DRS systems from the main version.

Unique to the handheld versions is a number of mini-game challenges such as checkpoints races, overtaking, autocross-style slaloms or racing in specific situations such as the last two laps of a race in the rain with the wrong tires equipped. They are organized in tiers with a bonus one at the end. The performance in these challenges is ranked with a letter. The game can be played online and for the 3DS StreetPass is used to unlock rival ghosts. Both versions support multiplayer, local as well as online, in head-to-head time trails or in a full Grand Prix. On the Vita the front touch screen is used to change the camera and the rear touch pad can be used as an optional substitute for actions such as braking and throttling.

Differences from the console version include downgraded graphics, a simplified damage model and certain animated sequences that have been cut.</desc>

		<desc>The games offer 13 levels (based around the first and second seasons of the TV series), which mostly consist of the platform puzzle-solving layout as previous LEGO video game efforts (whilst defeating a multitude of droids along the way as well as other familiar foes). Most levels also take place in flight-mode, where players need to carry out several missions e.g. defeating an army of vulture droids. Each level is split into 3 acts (which are then available to play separately as part of Free Play mode).</desc>

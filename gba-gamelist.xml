		<desc>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics.

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

		<desc>Spyro Orange is Vicarious Visions' first Spyro the Dragon title, taking the reigns after Digital Eclipse's GBA trilogy. For Spyro's fourth appearance on the Game Boy Advance, the development team has given the dragon a more traditional side-scrolling environment for his overworld instead of taking him back to his isometric exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer challenges.</desc>

		<desc>Super Bust-A-Move brings with it all of the entertaining puzzle action of the series with the addition of new multiplayer modes and graphical improvements.

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.

Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</desc>

Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman). 

Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube.

Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Battle</name>
		<desc>Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game akin to Super Smash Bros. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D.

There are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.

The game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).

The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</desc>

		<desc>Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire has all the features you'd demand of a pinball game, including bonus tables, lots of bumpers and ways to score massive points. As with your standard pinball video game, the left button on the D-pad and the A-button control the flippers with the R/L triggers used to shake the table. The catch here is that everything is themed in Pokémon. Instead of a ball, you make use of a Pokéball. Instead of standard bumpers, you're hitting the Pokéball against other Pokémon, and the ultimate goal is of course to "catch 'em all". The game features 200 Pokémon, two main tables, and link cable support.</desc>

		<desc>Marche and a few friends are out on a usual venture through their local town, St. Ivalice, only to discover a book filled with fantasy and magic. Setting their mind to the thoughts of a magical land, they get transported to the world of Ivalice, which happens to be based on one of the friends' favourite games, Final Fantasy.

Finding himself alone, Marche must join a clan of warriors and travel through this new land of mystery to find his lost friends, and return to the real world, while learning all about this new place and the magic it holds.

Not a direct sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, FFTA combines the many elements of the tactical original with a slightly modern feel, and an original storyline for the GBA. As a clan leader, you must manage your team (from their combat skills and inventory to each and every battle you face).

Both your basic handheld weapons and magic are available to you, with the ability to summon monsters for support. Two players can link GBA's for battles, trading items and clan members as well.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</name>
		<desc>The Tony Hawk skateboarding series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with this adaptation of the second Pro Skater game.

Gameplay is similar to the original console game. The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</desc>

While A Link to the Past is largely a faithful port of the original, it does include an entirely new dungeon and a new quest as rewards for the player playing through the multiplayer-only Four Swords. Aside from these additions, it includes a number of smaller gameplay and dialogue changes, the latter of which are designed to correct a number of minor translation mistakes and inconsistencies with the original Japanese release and to unify the common terms used with the later games.</desc>

Ryu and his best friend Bow are apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers they take on posted jobs needed by the townspeople. However it isn't long before one job goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will explore the world, eventually discovering the meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside himself.

Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The majority of game is played from a top-down map, however battles are seen from an isometric view. Ryu will form parties from among 8 other characters, each with their own set of skills and powers that will help him discover the truth behind the mystery. 

In the GBA version, you can use a link-cable to link to a friends and exchange weapons and items to defeat the higher evils. And with the inclusion of the community system, you can build and maintain your own city while you are fed up of exploring.</desc>

		<desc>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.

Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</desc>

Like the previous GBA releases of the series, it's an isometric representation of the console levels combined with polygonal characters.  It contains both a story mode, in which you create a rookie skater and take him or her on a world tour with pros to improve their skills and win prizes; and a classic mode, in which you must accomplish various goals such as tricking off objects or getting a high score within two minutes.  Changes in this iteration include removing the timer from most goals in story mode, allowing you to have several active at once and new moves like the nata spin, tantrum, which allows you to recover from a bail without losing everything, focus, where you can slow time in order to land the best trick and sticker-slapping.</desc>

Once again, Sonic is called upon to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman. On this occasion, Sonic is joined by friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream and rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. Each comes with a set of unique moves, allowing you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must compelte the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters.

Chaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle with Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus stage. Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours.

You'll also get the chance to collect and raise chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on Gamecube, through the use of the GBA/GC link cable.</desc>

New abilities, thanks to power ups littered around the levels, allow Rayman to use the likes of Heavy Metal Fist and the Shock Rocket to take down enemies around him, while the lock jaw allows Rayman to get to hard to reach places.

Rayman 3 can link to a Gamecube via the link port, allowing players to play exclusive mini-games on both systems and download new levels to the GBA.</desc>

		<name>Kururin Paradise</name>
		<desc>Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.

Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using only one cart.

The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.</desc>

		<name>Wade Hixton's Counter Punch</name>
		<desc>During a little trip, young Wade Hixton finds himself stranded as his car breaks down. Luckily, or unluckily for him, a small town is nearby. Calling in for help, he find the people of Big Piney more then happy to help ... at a price. Wade must now strap on the boxing gloves and fight his way around the town against a range of strange characters ready to punch his lights out. To make enough money to fix the car, and make it out of the town alive, he'll be put to the test in and out of the ring.

The non-linear style of the game leaves you with all the options. You will choose who to fight, who to trust to make the right business decisions, and who your hard earned money should be spent on to purchase their help at a time of crisis in the ring. Wade's life and his car rest in your gloved hands.</desc>

The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick Virus. But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him.

A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!</desc>

		<desc>Pokémon FireRed Version and LeafGreen Version are enhanced remakes of the original Pokémon Red and Blue video games, which were released in 1996. They were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles. The two games hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man Collection</name>
		<desc>Four classic Pac-Man games are included in this collection from Namco:

1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut. 
2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well as adding the ability to jump.
3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.
Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.</desc>

Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped "Dark Elf," before it's able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. 

In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.</desc>

		<path>./Street Fighter Alpha 3 (E) [!].gba</path>
		<name>Street Fighter Alpha 3</name>
		<desc>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

Versus - Two human players battle it out. 

Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).

Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.</desc>

		<path>./Mother 3 (J) [T+Eng].gba</path>
		<name>Mother 3</name>
		<desc>The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. 

Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). 

There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. 

There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</name>
		<desc>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.

The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</desc>

		<name>Ecks V Sever</name>
		<desc>Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy...

In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. 

As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.

The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</desc>

		<name>Karnaaj Rally</name>
		<desc>Karnaaj Rally is a handheld racing game which is played from a top down perspective and mixes 2D and 3D graphics. It's an arcade racer similar to Micro Machines where the player competes against three other racers on a number of different tracks. To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to stop the competition from winning. 

The game's career mode allows the player to compete and  progress in four different race series. Each of these has unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car's tires and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There's also a gambling option. The player can bet by guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order. 

The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</desc>

		<path>./Monster Rancher Advance (USA).gba</path>
		<name>Monster Rancher Advance</name>
		<desc>Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 

Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.

Players then train the monsters by choosing  which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age.

There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay value.

The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.</desc>

		<path>./Racing Gears Advance (U).gba</path>
		<name>Racing Gears Advance</name>
		<desc>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</desc>

		<name>Rhythm Tengoku</name>
		<desc>Rhythm Tengoku is a music game based around good timing and rhythm.  The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware.  This is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.

As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package.  Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing.  Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.  At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</desc>

Fortunately Spyro has generally avoided such negative opinions, but then again he hasn't always had it easy either. You'd think that after several death-defying adventures on the Playstation over the past few years, which included the defeat of the evil Sorceress, Spyro and his friends would be able to take some time off and enjoy a bit of a vacation at Dragon Shores.

There's seven different levels in total and includes a jungle, volcano and a space station. 

There's a number of power ups or items available that are necessary to complete a challenge. First of all the player ha to fins keys to unlock doors. These come in different colors that have to match. Some tiles have arrows on them which force the player in the direction they face. To overcome this the player can use his turbo speed. Some of the ground is weak and can collapse when rolling over it. Often the player will come across gaps. For this there's a build item and a jump item. There's also gravity and wind which drag or push the the player. The turtle's shell can be upgraded in three ways. There's a glide shell which allows the player to go faster over slow ground, the panzer shell which allows the player to pass through force fields and the spike shell which allows the player to get a better grip on slippery ground such as ice.</desc>

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden Remix</name>
		<desc>Toshinden Remix or Toshinden S as it was called in Japan is a port of Takara's Playstation fighting game Battle Arena Toshinden to the Sega Saturn by Sega.

It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.

The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.

Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.

Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Wars</name>
		<desc>Bomberman Wars is a video game in the Bomberman series released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on April 16, 1998. The main character is King Bomber who rules over his kingdom. The object of the game is to conquer all the pieces of the Bomber country. Eventually you fight the main villain, Bagular, and his four henchmen.

This is one of the earliest games in the Bomberman series to stray away from its party game roots and focus more on the single player component (though it did have a VS mode). It is the third Bomberman game for the Saturn, and the second for the PlayStation.</desc>

The plot centers around the "spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor" - Carrigan Crittenden.  She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.

Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare "Fleshies" and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</desc>

		<name>Daytona USA</name>
		<desc>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.

These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer). 

On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.</desc>

The player(s) use a variety of firearms, explosives, melee weapons, and other techniques to destroy the enemy for a set number of rounds, usually a single battle, or best two out of three rounds, like fighting games. The game is made to be played with a two-joystick setup, known as the twin-sticks. Each stick is equipped with a trigger and a button on top of the stick. The twin sticks control the virtuaroid on screen much like a bulldozer. Pushing or pulling both sticks in one direction makes it move in that direction, while pushing one stick forward and pulling the other back makes it turn in the forward direction. Pulling the sticks apart causes the virtuaroid to jump into the air, and automatically turn to face the opponent. Pulling them towards each other while pulling a trigger causes the virtuaroid to prone while firing.</desc>

		<name>Doom</name>
		<desc>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell.[2] With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people[3] within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "Doom clones". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of controversy.

The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as Doom</desc>

		<desc>Aliens have landed in futuristic Los Angeles and it's up to the Duke to bring the pain and show them the door. After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduced a first-person perspective to the series and turned the game in a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.

Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.

The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jet pack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.

The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard Arcade</name>
		<desc>A conversion of Sega AM1's arcade 3D scrolling fighting game based on the first Die Hard movie. One or two players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter.
A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement.
Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock!
Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items.
The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the skyscraper.
Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.</desc>

		<desc>Die Hard Trilogy is split into three games, each game representing one of the movies, obviously.  

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. 

Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place.

Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</desc>

		<name>Fighters Megamix</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  

In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.  Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.

Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.

One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.

This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</desc>

		<desc>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.

While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. 

Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.

Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.

Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.</desc>

		<name>Galactic Attack</name>
		<desc>Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce (GunLock for European arcades). A top-down shooter, there are seven levels to play, ranging from battles in the atmosphere of planets to battling over mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of these levels. The player takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818 X-LAY, out to destroy any opposing forces.

The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a massive super computer called Con-Human to help with the planet's environment, providing nutrients to the earth and caring for the ecosystem. However, a cloned human is linked with the system and makes Con-Human a sentient being. The system eventually becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters, wiping all nearly all of mankind and destroying the ecosystem, driving the survivors into space to develop colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into a giant fortress and is assembling a massive armada to destroy the remaining survivors, but before it can attack, the survivors amass a first strike in order to reclaim the Earth.

The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon to destroy various enemies flying in and out of the screen.  Players can upgrade this weapon by collecting "L" icons floating around when enough enemies are destroyed.  There is also a secondary weapon, a lock-on missile launcher, that has the ability to fire upon eight different ground enemies at once.</desc>

		<name>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams...</name>
		<desc>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams is a one level themed "demo" of NiGHTS into Dreams. It was originally released in November 1996 for the Sega Saturn.
Due to its freebie nature, Christmas NiGHTS is a much smaller game than NiGHTS into Dreams - there is only one level (Spring Valley - almost identical to the level seen in regular NiGHTS) however unlike the original it is playable as Elliot as well as Claris. When playing as Elliot the stage is mirrored.
Christmas NiGHTS is Christmas-themed, and so its graphics and music have been replaced with winter-esque versions of the original stage (but only in winter). For example, Ideya Captures are now giant floating Christmas trees, and NiGHTS wears red attire rather than purple. Gameplay is largely identical to the original game, including the A-Life system altered by defeating enemies.</desc>

		<name>Clockwork Knight : Pepperouchau's Adventure</name>
		<desc>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.

The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.

Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</desc>

		<desc>Clockwork Knight 2 is the second (and to this date, last) game featuring the adventures of Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III. It maintains the same game style (a mixture of 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D elements, moderately in the fashion of Sega Saturn's Bug!), colorful music and gameplay of its predecessor. However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.</desc>

		<name>Deadalus</name>
		<desc>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.

The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.</desc>

		<desc>Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order. 

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

The occupants of the underwater facility are ordered to board the submarine and find out what went wrong. On board the vessel, strange things are happening which are taking control of the crew. The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it!

 The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</desc>

		<path>./Defcon 5 (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Defcon 5</name>
		<desc>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. 

As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</desc>

		<name>Defcon 5 : Peace Has a Price...</name>
		<desc>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. 

As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</desc>

		<name>Deka 4-ku : Tough the Truck</name>
		<desc>Hardcore 4x4 (initially known as TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 in the US and known as Deka Yonku ~Tough The Truck~in Japan) is a racing video game developed by Gremlin Interactive for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It became available for download from PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic for play on the PlayStation 3 on January 10, 2008, in PAL regions.[4] The game utilizes 3D environments and truck models. The soundtrack features hard rock music. It was the first game to feature vehicles with independent suspension.[citation needed]

In 1996, ASC (publisher) hired Top Dog Entertainment in Austin, Texas, to develop Hardcore 4x4 II (the second version). The first Sony PlayStation developer in the Americas, Brett Butler, was lead programmer. He travelled to England to collect the game code and world builder tools. Both were defective, so he spent the first month repairing the code base. He then designed new tracks, rebuilt the graphics engine in MIPS RISC R3000 assembly, and hired artists and designers to create new tracks, menu interfaces, and vehicles. The title was completed in late 1997 as Top Dog went out of business shortly after Brett Butler left the company.[citation needed]</desc>

Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top.

		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<desc>Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order. 

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

		<name>Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers</name>
		<desc>Amami City is a Japanese megalopolis of the near future. In this huge city, each house has a computer, and all computers are linked to one big network. The flow of information is being controlled by the government, and software companies create huge virtual locations-networks. An eighteen-year-old member of a hacker group called Spookies and his companions gain access to one of these networks - a virtual city called Paradigm-X, created by Algon Soft. However, an accident occurs during the hacking, and a mysterious demon who calls herself Nemissa emerges. The Spookies must find the true reason behind Nemissa's arrival, and confront a shadowy organization known as Phantom Society, which employs demon summoners. Soul Hackers is similar in its themes, structure and gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.</desc>

The game is played via a standard text interface were you select your actions and interact with other characters and places. Obviously, being a hentai game, there are many depictions of hardcore sexual situations so don't say you weren't warned.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place in the small fictitious harbour town Amami City in Japan. The company Algon Soft has made Amami its headquarters, which has led to the technology in the city quickly being upgraded; Algon Soft has connected every home and business in the city to its new network in order to demonstrate how a ?city of tomorrow? could work. The Japanese government is impressed, and grants Algon Soft permission to expand the network across the rest of Japan in the coming years. It also takes place in the virtual world Paradigm X on Algon Soft's servers, where the citizens of Amami can visit virtual attractions.</desc>

		<name>Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers</name>
		<desc>Amami City is a Japanese megalopolis of the near future. In this huge city, each house has a computer, and all computers are linked to one big network. The flow of information is being controlled by the government, and software companies create huge virtual locations-networks. An eighteen-year-old member of a hacker group called Spookies and his companions gain access to one of these networks - a virtual city called Paradigm-X, created by Algon Soft. However, an accident occurs during the hacking, and a mysterious demon who calls herself Nemissa emerges. The Spookies must find the true reason behind Nemissa's arrival, and confront a shadowy organization known as Phantom Society, which employs demon summoners. Soul Hackers is similar in its themes, structure and gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.</desc>

		<desc>DJ Wars is a Sega Saturn rhythm game. It came with a free sheet of stickers.

DJ Wars is essentially a free-form rhythm-music game, without the strict control of, say, Dance Dance Revolution.  This seems to be much closer - interestingly enough - to Nintendo's Wii Music.  The game sends you, an aspiring DJ, to various clubs to impress the dancers and show off your skills.  There are no guidelines telling you exactly what to do and when to do it; you really have to discover the flow and learn what each crowd likes.  In that sense, it's much more of a DJ simulation than anything.</desc>

However, while they're flying across the galaxy, they wind up making an emergency landing on a strange planet after a collision... and are attacked by strange robots as soon as they land! Now, Nobita and his friends must figure out what's happened on this strange planet, and find a way to repair their ship and get home!

Doraemon: Nobita to Fukkatsu no Hoshi ("Doraemon: Nobita and the Planet of Revival") is a side-scrolling action platformer, and one of the many titles based on the long-running children's cartoon. The game is divided into short platform stages, each with a specific objective or goal that must be completed to move on. Between stages, there are voiced visual novel-style sequences which move the story forward. There are sometimes choices available in these sections, which can affect which stage the player reaches next.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Ball Z : Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Dragon Ball Z: The Legend utilizes a unique system of play that is different from most other fighters. The graphics feature 2D sprites in a three dimensional world. Although each battle begins on the ground, the majority of the action is featured skyward. 
The characters fly around each and utilize rapid punches and kicks, and Ki Blasts, either singularly or rapidly by holding the assigned button for a short period of time. 
The characters have a limited amount of ki that can be charged over time. If the player uses all of their available ki, their character will stop fighting out of exhaustion, leaving them wide open for an attack. The life meter is a scale made up of energy from both sides that shifts depending on damage taken, and after one side is depleted, the character performs a special "Meteor Attack", which takes place in a cut scene and finishes off the opponent. Each match is made up of two teams that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched out at various times.</desc>

		<desc>It is the world's first networked RPG with consumer game consoles as the main platform. Initially, only the client software for Sega Saturn was released, but later the client for Windows was also announced.

The game takes place as a 3D dungeon crawler RPG.

The game world (server) was unique and all participants played on the same server regardless of the platform (pc or saturn). 

There are two main worlds, the human world "Messeria" and the parallel demon world "Tyzeria".
It is said that an experiment conducted by scientists in Messeria created a hole in space-time and that the demon invasion started from Tyzeria.</desc>

Elevator Action Returns retains the elevator-based gimmick from the original, but expands and improves on the gameplay system and replaces the spy motif with a new scenario involving a paramilitary team fighting against a terrorist group. The mostly well-received game was ported to the Sega Saturn and released only in Japan as Elevator Action² Returns in 1997, and later included in Taito Legends 2 compilation release for the PlayStation 2, Windows and Xbox in 2006.</desc>

		<name>Enemy Zero</name>
		<desc>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series. 

The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.

The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.

The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.

David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.</desc>

		<name>Firestorm : Thunderhawk 2</name>
		<desc>Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.

Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC &amp; Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.</desc>

		<desc>This interactive movie puts a new twist on the Frankenstein tale: you are the monster! You have been falsely accused of murder and executed. However, the scientist Dr. Frankenstein (played by Tim Curry) has found a way to bring you back to life. You wake up in his laboratory, and your goal is to find out what exactly happened to you and what role Frankenstein played in your resurrection. Will you be able to return back to your former self?

The game plays entirely from first-person perspective. You wander around the huge laboratory, looking for clues and solving puzzles. Sometimes events will happen in the game, triggered by careful research of Frankenstein's notes and other clues. The game features live actors filmed over pre-rendered backgrounds.</desc>

Characters include a Ryu from Street Fighter look-a-like as well as Honey from Fighting Vipers and many others.

		<name>Funky Head Boxers</name>
		<desc>Released to the arcades on Sega's ST-V (Saturn-based) board in 1996, Funky Head Boxers stylishly pits two fighters with texture-mapped cubes for heads against one another. The game takes a comic approach to boxing, with fighters donning, in additional to the usual cuts and bruises, some off-the-wall expressions, tears, and even runny noses as they take hits. After a heavy blow, the fighters' heads change expressions and deform. The unique style of the game isn't limited to the fighters though. The audience has the same funky skulls and even the ref is a "block head" with the word "referee" is scrawled over his face.

Funky Head Boxers found its way to the Sega Saturn in 1997, but only in Japan. While the game may not be remembered today, it represents a time when the arcades were successful and developers were willing to create games that, if nothing else, at least had unique and novel style of their own.</desc>

		<name>Garou Densetsu 3 : Road to the Final Victory</name>
		<desc>Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or "oversway" into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a "Quick Sway" to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.

Other new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts, allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a "Hidden Ability", which is a stronger version of a Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating "Super Mode" before a match using a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round.

Fatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a round, their performance is graded from D to SSS. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the Single Player Mode is determined then by the player's average.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.</desc>

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Black Matrix</name>
		<desc>The cosmic battle between angels and demons ended in the demons' victory. They took control of the world and reversed the ideology of the angels to suit their own demonic nature. The most positive and beautiful emotions belonged to the seven mortal sins. Angels were deprived of their rights and had to exist as slaves, obeying their demon masters in everything. You play an angel named Abel. In the beginning, you choose your master from several available characters. Your master, however, is soon accused of love - one of the seven greatest sins. You have to escape from prison, where you were thrown shortly after your master was banned, and to find a way to save your master.

"Black/Matrix" is a strategy RPG that is divided into large battles and story sequences. You fight in turn-based mode by moving your party members on an isometric battle field, attacking and using magic, for which you require blood of defeated enemies. The experience points you gather after the battle can then be divided among your party members the way you like.</desc>

A nuclear shockwave has all but destroyed the entire population of Earth. The remaining humans on the planet were gathered aboard a ship called the Ark by a prophetic man named Noa. After the radiation dissipated, humankind emerged from the Ark and began building thriving civilizations.

However, the fledgling civilization came under attack by a culture called Gorn. Gorn was a culture consisting of the embodiment of machines and artificiality. During the nuclear winter, Gorn was sealed beneath the Earth's crust and emerged when the remaining humans came out of the Ark. Humanity must fight back against Gorn, using ancient weapons unearthed by the new civilization and two "Ultimate Destroyers" known as Kyo and Forn.</desc>

		<name>Blue Breaker : Ken yori mo Hohoemi o</name>
		<desc>The world of Blue Breaker is called "the path in the middle of empty sky": floating islands connected with each other by bridges. It is the tradition of the people in this world that a fighter's full initiation can be completed only when he finds his true love and marries her. Such day has come now in the life of a young warrior named Kain, the hero of the game. His father explains to him that besides the usual warrior's goal of defeating the evil Dark Lord, Kain also has to find the girl of his dreams. He introduces to him a young sorceress named Asha, who becomes his first companion. But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!

Labeled as Love Role-Playing, "Blue Breaker" is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with "love adventure", in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. "Blue Breaker" features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on. It is also important to form a party in which the girls will have as few internal conflicts with each other as possible.</desc>

Bulk Slash [has a] Neo-Tokyo feel ala Neon Genesis Evangelion persona to it. You start off on mission based objectives; having them explained using 3D maps of the areas. Your mech is equipped with machine guns, grenades, a laser sword for close combat, and the ability to transform into a jet. The jet has twin machine guns and can launch six homing missiles at a time reflecting Panzer Dragoon type gameplay. With a true full-360 degree range of movement you can go anywhere on foot, and you can fly anywhere in jet mode. Powerups are everywhere, from flamethrowers, homing lasers and electric bolt grenades. Each objective is different; from destroying main targets, to protecting a ship from being destroyed. But every level has a boss encounter. Most bosses are huge, and take up most of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.

This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</desc>

		<name>Command &amp; Conquer</name>
		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Criticom</name>
		<desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.

The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2027 the world is controlled by two rival super-powers, the western-bloc Free World Alliance and the east-bloc Cartel.

Transmissions from an FWA spy reveal the location of a secret multi-national labratory deep within Siberia, the "Cyberia Complex", where a mysterious weapon is being developed. FWA leader Devlin frees a cyber-hacker named Zak from prison and sends him to infiltrate the complex and discover the true nature of the Cyberia weapon.

Unfortunately, the Cartel is also interested in the weapon and will stop at nothing to get it. Not only must Zak make his way past the Cartel forces sent to stop him, but he must also overcome the Cartel agents which have already seized control of the complex. To make matters worse the Cyberian scientist's genetically engineered creations are running rampant in the same area as the weapon, and Devlin also appears to be have something up his sleeve.</desc>

		<name>Enemy Zero</name>
		<desc>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series. 

The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.

The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

		<name>FIFA Soccer 96</name>
		<desc>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

		<name>Angelique Special 2</name>
		<desc>Following the events of the first Angelique game, Angelique Limoges has become the queen of Cosmos, and her former rival Rosalie - her aid. Now a whole new Cosmos has appeared, and it's time to choose a new queen for it. The candidates this time are Angelique Collet (the protagonist of the game) and Rachel Hart.
The gameplay system remains largely unchanged in this sequel. Once again, Angelique has to use diplomacy to make the Nine Guardians lend her their powers (making the inhabitants of her land happy), or develop stronger feelings for her. New in this sequel is the ability to work with three different instructors, developing mind, sense, or dignity of the heroine, which will influence the way she interacts with other characters and also affect the behavior of the Guardians.</desc>

		<name>Arcade Gears Vol. 1 : Pu-Li-Ru-La</name>
		<desc>Pu-Li-Ru-La is a psychedelic side-scrolling arcade beat 'em up set in the magical land of Radishland. As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their "invented magic sticks" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.

Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder "boss" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.

The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

You start with a limited number of Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>The Armageddon came. A huge Heat Wave ruined the planet, humans have mutated into strange creatures who worship strange gods, trying to exterminate each other in bloody wars, and Ikei demons populate the surface of the planet. In the middle of the wasteland stands the Nerve Tower. Nobody knows what it is: the symbol of evil or the final hope for salvation, because nobody ever dared to enter it. But the hero of the game is determined to explore the tower, and perhaps to cleanse the world of evil once and for all.

"Baroque" is a survival horror adventure. The whole game is set in the tower: you slowly work your way to the top, fighting demons as you progress. You have HP as well as stamina gauge. If your stamina is depleted, you walk slower and can't react well in a battle.</desc>

		<name>Advanced V.G.</name>
		<desc>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. 

Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.</desc>

		<name>Airs Adventure</name>
		<desc>Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe. The game follows the story of an aspiring knight (default name Henry), who is framed for a crime and is about to be executed. However, the beautiful princess of the country feels mercy and stops the execution at the last moment. As the hero tries to uncover the truth about his conviction, fate brings the two together, and they begin a journey to discover distant lands in search for adventure, and perhaps even develop feelings for each other...

The game's combat is a rather simple version of the traditional Japanese-style RPG system. The player controls a party that contains only Henry and the princess. Whenever enemies are encountered, a separate battle screen appears. Commands are executed via a standard menu, allowing physical attacks, defense, as well as offensive and supporting magic spells. Graphically, Airs Adventure combines pre-rendered character sprites with partially polygonal backgrounds, with an over-the-shoulder view.</desc>

		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<name>All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas</name>
		<desc>Regardless of a sports game's features, it lives or dies by two things: play control and graphics. All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas is a good example of a feature-heavy game that has adequate play control and adequate graphics. The end result: an adequate game that lacks the polish and finesse needed to be great.

All-Star Baseball features all 30 Major League teams, including the new Tampa Bay and Arizona teams; over seven hundred real MLB players; 28 stadiums to play in; the complete 1997 schedule, including the new interleague games; player trades; and 27 category statistics from STATS, Inc. In addition, there are six modes of gameplay: exhibition, season, playoffs, all-star game, home run derby, and batting practice. In terms of features it is definitely on par with the other titles out there.</desc>

		<name>Alone in the Dark : Jack Is Back</name>
		<desc>It is Christmas of 1924, three months after Alone in the Dark. "Supernatural Private Eye" Edward Carnby and his partner Ted Stryker are investigating the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. The trail of clues leads to an old mansion named "Hell's Kitchen" - the home of an infamous gangster boss and his gang. Edward decides to pick up the trail when he learns of Ted's disappearance in the mansion. Unfortunately, Edward soon finds out that Ted has been murdered.
Carnby eventually finds out that the mobsters are the corporeal forms of the spirits of pirates that plundered the sea hundreds of years ago, the lot having sold their souls in exchange for eternal life through voodoo magic. Fighting his way into the house and ultimately onto a pirate ship hidden in the cliff on which Jack's house is built, Edward must survive, discover the secret of the pirates' apparent immortality, rescue little Grace, and find out why the pirates are so interested in her.</desc>

		<path>./Amok (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Amok</name>
		<desc>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.

Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.

The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</desc>

		<desc>This is the home port of the popular arcade light gun game. This home version has special bonuses and additional secret levels not found in the arcade. Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.

As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</desc>

		<name>Assault Rigs</name>
		<desc>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.

Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.

Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.

Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</desc>

Seeing as how all the fighters have magical abilities, the fights take place in mid-air, allowing you and your opponent to fly all over the arena while you try to defeat each other using your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and super attacks (which deplete your energy bar but cause tremendous damage).

Graphics-wise the games uses 2D sprites, with colorful doll-ish designs. Gameplay modes include 1P arcade, 2P Vs mode, an art gallery featuring conceptual artwork and a story mode with selectable dialogue options that influence match difficulty.</desc>

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden URA : Ultimate Revenge Attack</name>
		<desc>The Toshinden Tournament is over. Through the battles some of the fighters have uncovered much about the shadowy events surrounding their lives. But the others now head home with little more than a few bruises and unfulfilled dreams. None of them, however, are aware that a new battle is about to begin.

Throughout the world, martial arts experts are disappearing. Police from various nations are cooperating in an international manhunt to find the criminal responsible for the murders. Yet no motive has been established, and there is little evidence available. A wave of terror has struck the world, and now even the strongest and bravest of fighters are not safe.

The former contestants of the Toshinden Tournament find themselves in a world gone mad. It is not inconceivable that one of them is responsible for the current chaos. But who is behind the disappearances, and for what purpose? All of the fighters came to the Toshinden Tournament for different reasons, but they are all fighting for the same reason now: SURVIVAL.</desc>

		<name>BattleSport</name>
		<desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. 

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

While searching the woods near the city, the team is attacked by bloodthirsty dogs and they have to retreat to a nearby mansion. 

The player chooses between Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield and starts to explore the mansion. It soon becomes very clear that it isn't just any mansion, but a hellish place where the undead walk the corridors and other horrors are lurking in the darkness, waiting to eat some heads. While solving puzzles, collecting keys, and shooting monsters, the player has to unravel the mystery behind this mansion and, if possible, get out alive.

Exclusive to the SEGA Saturn version is a Battle Mode bonus mode, where, with limited ammo and under the threat of limited time, the player must survive a series of rooms filled with monsters</desc>

Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top.

Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</desc>

		<name>Defcon 5</name>
		<desc>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. 

As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</desc>

		<name>Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers</name>
		<desc>Amami City is a Japanese megalopolis of the near future. In this huge city, each house has a computer, and all computers are linked to one big network. The flow of information is being controlled by the government, and software companies create huge virtual locations-networks. An eighteen-year-old member of a hacker group called Spookies and his companions gain access to one of these networks - a virtual city called Paradigm-X, created by Algon Soft. However, an accident occurs during the hacking, and a mysterious demon who calls herself Nemissa emerges. The Spookies must find the true reason behind Nemissa's arrival, and confront a shadowy organization known as Phantom Society, which employs demon summoners. Soul Hackers is similar in its themes, structure and gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.</desc>

		<name>Enemy Zero</name>
		<desc>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series. 

The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.

The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

		<name>FIFA Soccer 97</name>
		<desc>FIFA 97 (also known as FIFA Soccer 97) is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football (soccer). It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.

FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.

David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<name>Black Matrix</name>
		<desc>The cosmic battle between angels and demons ended in the demons' victory. They took control of the world and reversed the ideology of the angels to suit their own demonic nature. The most positive and beautiful emotions belonged to the seven mortal sins. Angels were deprived of their rights and had to exist as slaves, obeying their demon masters in everything. You play an angel named Abel. In the beginning, you choose your master from several available characters. Your master, however, is soon accused of love - one of the seven greatest sins. You have to escape from prison, where you were thrown shortly after your master was banned, and to find a way to save your master.

"Black/Matrix" is a strategy RPG that is divided into large battles and story sequences. You fight in turn-based mode by moving your party members on an isometric battle field, attacking and using magic, for which you require blood of defeated enemies. The experience points you gather after the battle can then be divided among your party members the way you like.</desc>

The gameplay system remains largely unchanged in this sequel.

New in this sequel is the ability to work with three different instructors, developing mind, sense, or dignity of the heroine, which will influence the way she interacts with other characters and also affect the behavior of the Guardians.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.

As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</desc>

The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.

The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jet pack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.

The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.</desc>

		<name>Daytona USA</name>
		<desc>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.

These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer). 

On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.</desc>

The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier. All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.</desc>

The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space.  Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.

		<name>Daytona USA</name>
		<desc>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.

These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer). 

On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.</desc>

		<name>Deadalus</name>
		<desc>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.

The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.</desc>

		<name>Defcon 5 : Peace Has a Price...</name>
		<desc>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. 

As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</desc>

The soundtrack features hard rock music. It was the first game to feature vehicles with independent suspension.[citation needed]

In 1996, ASC (publisher) hired Top Dog Entertainment in Austin, Texas, to develop Hardcore 4x4 II (the second version). The first Sony PlayStation developer in the Americas, Brett Butler, was lead programmer. He travelled to England to collect the game code and world builder tools. Both were defective, so he spent the first month repairing the code base. He then designed new tracks, rebuilt the graphics engine in MIPS RISC R3000 assembly, and hired artists and designers to create new tracks, menu interfaces, and vehicles. The title was completed in late 1997 as Top Dog went out of business shortly after Brett Butler left the company.[citation needed]</desc>

		<desc>Delisoba Deluxe was made as a tie-in to TBS's mid- 1990s Japanese game show Tokyo Friend Park, where one of the games, Delisoba (?delivery soba?), had celebrities command a virtual motorcycle trying to deliver soba to the Fuji Network TV Studios. Deluxe is a ?port? of this game to the Saturn, which adds features such as a time attack and track editor, and was not sold in stores, but rather given away at the show (either to winners or to audience members).</desc>

		<name>Dennou Senki : Virtual On, Cyber Troopers</name>
		<desc>Virtual On is set up similar to a Versus fighting game. Two virtuaroids (Mecha) face each other on a stage. The player(s) use a variety of firearms, explosives, melee weapons, and other techniques to destroy the enemy for a set number of rounds, usually a single battle, or best two out of three rounds, like fighting games. The game is made to be played with a two-joystick setup, known as the twin-sticks. Each stick is equipped with a trigger and a button on top of the stick. The twin sticks control the virtuaroid on screen much like a bulldozer. Pushing or pulling both sticks in one direction makes it move in that direction, while pushing one stick forward and pulling the other back makes it turn in the forward direction. Pulling the sticks apart causes the virtuaroid to jump into the air, and automatically turn to face the opponent. Pulling them towards each other while pulling a trigger causes the virtuaroid to prone while firing.</desc>

		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

However, the powers of the Queen and the Guardians fade over time, and successors must be appointed. In the first game and its various remakes, the protagonist is a 17-year-old girl named Angelique Limoges who has been chosen by the current Queen and her aide Dia as one of two candidates from the Royal Smallney Girls' Academy to become the next Queen.

		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Daytona USA : Circuit Edition</name>
		<desc>All of its predecessor and then some. More tracks, many more cars (hidden cars as well), smarter AI, more music (no more lyrics for the in-game race music either), broader 2-player gameplay, more refined arcade physics...and on top of everything else- BETTER GRAPHICS! The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier. All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.</desc>

		<desc>Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order. 

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

		<name>Doom</name>
		<desc>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell.[2] With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people[3] within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "Doom clones". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of controversy.

The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as Doom</desc>

		<name>Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers</name>
		<desc>Amami City is a Japanese megalopolis of the near future. In this huge city, each house has a computer, and all computers are linked to one big network. The flow of information is being controlled by the government, and software companies create huge virtual locations-networks. An eighteen-year-old member of a hacker group called Spookies and his companions gain access to one of these networks - a virtual city called Paradigm-X, created by Algon Soft. However, an accident occurs during the hacking, and a mysterious demon who calls herself Nemissa emerges. The Spookies must find the true reason behind Nemissa's arrival, and confront a shadowy organization known as Phantom Society, which employs demon summoners. Soul Hackers is similar in its themes, structure and gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.</desc>

The company Algon Soft has made Amami its headquarters, which has led to the technology in the city quickly being upgraded; Algon Soft has connected every home and business in the city to its new network in order to demonstrate how a ?city of tomorrow? could work. The Japanese government is impressed, and grants Algon Soft permission to expand the network across the rest of Japan in the coming years. It also takes place in the virtual world Paradigm X on Algon Soft's servers, where the citizens of Amami can visit virtual attractions.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard Arcade</name>
		<desc>A conversion of Sega AM1's arcade 3D scrolling fighting game based on the first Die Hard movie. One or two players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter.
A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement.
Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock!
Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items.
The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the skyscraper.
Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.</desc>

		<desc>Die Hard Trilogy is split into three games, each game representing one of the movies, obviously.  

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

Doraemon: Nobita to Fukkatsu no Hoshi ("Doraemon: Nobita and the Planet of Revival") is a side-scrolling action platformer, and one of the many titles based on the long-running children's cartoon. The game is divided into short platform stages, each with a specific objective or goal that must be completed to move on. Between stages, there are voiced visual novel-style sequences which move the story forward. There are sometimes choices available in these sections, which can affect which stage the player reaches next.</desc>

		<desc>DJ Wars is a Sega Saturn rhythm game. It came with a free sheet of stickers.

DJ Wars is essentially a free-form rhythm-music game, without the strict control of, say, Dance Dance Revolution.  This seems to be much closer - interestingly enough - to Nintendo's Wii Music.  The game sends you, an aspiring DJ, to various clubs to impress the dancers and show off your skills.  There are no guidelines telling you exactly what to do and when to do it; you really have to discover the flow and learn what each crowd likes.  In that sense, it's much more of a DJ simulation than anything.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Ball Z : Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Dragon Ball Z: The Legend utilizes a unique system of play that is different from most other fighters. The graphics feature 2D sprites in a three dimensional world. Although each battle begins on the ground, the majority of the action is featured skyward. 
The characters fly around each and utilize rapid punches and kicks, and Ki Blasts, either singularly or rapidly by holding the assigned button for a short period of time. 
The characters have a limited amount of ki that can be charged over time. If the player uses all of their available ki, their character will stop fighting out of exhaustion, leaving them wide open for an attack. The life meter is a scale made up of energy from both sides that shifts depending on damage taken, and after one side is depleted, the character performs a special "Meteor Attack", which takes place in a cut scene and finishes off the opponent. Each match is made up of two teams that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched out at various times.</desc>

		<name>Dynamite Deka</name>
		<desc>A conversion of Sega AM1's arcade 3D scrolling fighting game based on the first Die Hard movie. One or two players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter.
A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement.
Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock!
Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items.
The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the skyscraper.
Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.</desc>

Elevator Action Returns retains the elevator-based gimmick from the original, but expands and improves on the gameplay system and replaces the spy motif with a new scenario involving a paramilitary team fighting against a terrorist group. The mostly well-received game was ported to the Sega Saturn and released only in Japan as Elevator Action² Returns in 1997, and later included in Taito Legends 2 compilation release for the PlayStation 2, Windows and Xbox in 2006.</desc>

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. 

Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place.

Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</desc>

		<name>Enemy Zero</name>
		<desc>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series. 

The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.

The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

		<name>Fighters Megamix</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  

In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.  Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.

Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.

One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.

This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Dream</name>
		<desc>It is the world's first networked RPG with consumer game consoles as the main platform. Initially, only the client software for Sega Saturn was released, but later the client for Windows was also announced.

The game takes place as a 3D dungeon crawler RPG.

The game world (server) was unique and all participants played on the same server regardless of the platform (pc or saturn). 

There are two main worlds, the human world "Messeria" and the parallel demon world "Tyzeria".
It is said that an experiment conducted by scientists in Messeria created a hole in space-time and that the demon invasion started from Tyzeria.</desc>

		<desc>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.

While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. 

Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.

Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.

Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.</desc>

FFR was developed by Capcoms American staff, and is a follow up to the popular 2D side scrolling 1989 original Final Fight game, FFR however is a 1on1 3D fighter featuring 11 characters from the original.
The Saturn game was released in versions, a boxed set with the 4MB RAM cart, and as the single disk, this game requires the 4MB RAM cart to play.</desc>

		<name>Firestorm : Thunderhawk 2</name>
		<desc>Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.

Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC &amp; Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.</desc>

		<name>Frankenstein : Through the Eyes of the Monster</name>
		<desc>This interactive movie puts a new twist on the Frankenstein tale: you are the monster! You have been falsely accused of murder and executed. However, the scientist Dr. Frankenstein (played by Tim Curry) has found a way to bring you back to life. You wake up in his laboratory, and your goal is to find out what exactly happened to you and what role Frankenstein played in your resurrection. Will you be able to return back to your former self?

The game plays entirely from first-person perspective. You wander around the huge laboratory, looking for clues and solving puzzles. Sometimes events will happen in the game, triggered by careful research of Frankenstein's notes and other clues. The game features live actors filmed over pre-rendered backgrounds.</desc>

		<name>Funky Head Boxers</name>
		<desc>Released to the arcades on Sega's ST-V (Saturn-based) board in 1996, Funky Head Boxers stylishly pits two fighters with texture-mapped cubes for heads against one another. The game takes a comic approach to boxing, with fighters donning, in additional to the usual cuts and bruises, some off-the-wall expressions, tears, and even runny noses as they take hits. After a heavy blow, the fighters' heads change expressions and deform. The unique style of the game isn't limited to the fighters though. The audience has the same funky skulls and even the ref is a "block head" with the word "referee" is scrawled over his face.

Funky Head Boxers found its way to the Sega Saturn in 1997, but only in Japan. While the game may not be remembered today, it represents a time when the arcades were successful and developers were willing to create games that, if nothing else, at least had unique and novel style of their own.</desc>

		<name>Galactic Attack</name>
		<desc>Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce (GunLock for European arcades). A top-down shooter, there are seven levels to play, ranging from battles in the atmosphere of planets to battling over mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of these levels. The player takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818 X-LAY, out to destroy any opposing forces.

The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a massive super computer called Con-Human to help with the planet's environment, providing nutrients to the earth and caring for the ecosystem. However, a cloned human is linked with the system and makes Con-Human a sentient being. The system eventually becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters, wiping all nearly all of mankind and destroying the ecosystem, driving the survivors into space to develop colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into a giant fortress and is assembling a massive armada to destroy the remaining survivors, but before it can attack, the survivors amass a first strike in order to reclaim the Earth.

The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon to destroy various enemies flying in and out of the screen.  Players can upgrade this weapon by collecting "L" icons floating around when enough enemies are destroyed.  There is also a secondary weapon, a lock-on missile launcher, that has the ability to fire upon eight different ground enemies at once.</desc>

		<desc>Gals Panic SS is the first game in the Gals Panic series designed specifically for home consoles. That said, there is no nudity. It is very similar to Gals Panic 4 before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with Qix-like gameplay is used, but players spend 5 rounds on each girl.</desc>

		<name>Garou Densetsu 3 : Road to the Final Victory</name>
		<desc>Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or "oversway" into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a "Quick Sway" to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.

Other new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts, allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a "Hidden Ability", which is a stronger version of a Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating "Super Mode" before a match using a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round.

Fatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a round, their performance is graded from D to SSS. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the Single Player Mode is determined then by the player's average.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<name>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams...</name>
		<desc>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams is a one level themed "demo" of NiGHTS into Dreams. It was originally released in November 1996 for the Sega Saturn.
Due to its freebie nature, Christmas NiGHTS is a much smaller game than NiGHTS into Dreams - there is only one level (Spring Valley - almost identical to the level seen in regular NiGHTS) however unlike the original it is playable as Elliot as well as Claris. When playing as Elliot the stage is mirrored.
Christmas NiGHTS is Christmas-themed, and so its graphics and music have been replaced with winter-esque versions of the original stage (but only in winter). For example, Ideya Captures are now giant floating Christmas trees, and NiGHTS wears red attire rather than purple. Gameplay is largely identical to the original game, including the A-Life system altered by defeating enemies.</desc>

However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.</desc>

		<name>Clockwork Knight : Pepperouchau's Adventure</name>
		<desc>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.

The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.

Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</desc>

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

A nuclear shockwave has all but destroyed the entire population of Earth. The remaining humans on the planet were gathered aboard a ship called the Ark by a prophetic man named Noa. After the radiation dissipated, humankind emerged from the Ark and began building thriving civilizations.

However, the fledgling civilization came under attack by a culture called Gorn. Gorn was a culture consisting of the embodiment of machines and artificiality. During the nuclear winter, Gorn was sealed beneath the Earth's crust and emerged when the remaining humans came out of the Ark. Humanity must fight back against Gorn, using ancient weapons unearthed by the new civilization and two "Ultimate Destroyers" known as Kyo and Forn.</desc>

		<name>Blue Breaker : Ken yori mo Hohoemi o</name>
		<desc>The world of Blue Breaker is called "the path in the middle of empty sky": floating islands connected with each other by bridges. It is the tradition of the people in this world that a fighter's full initiation can be completed only when he finds his true love and marries her. Such day has come now in the life of a young warrior named Kain, the hero of the game. His father explains to him that besides the usual warrior's goal of defeating the evil Dark Lord, Kain also has to find the girl of his dreams. He introduces to him a young sorceress named Asha, who becomes his first companion. But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!

Labeled as Love Role-Playing, "Blue Breaker" is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with "love adventure", in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. "Blue Breaker" features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on. It is also important to form a party in which the girls will have as few internal conflicts with each other as possible.</desc>

		<desc>When Sonic Teams Burning Rangers was released on the Saturn, proclaimed to push the system to its limitsbut Bulk Slash still surpasses. With very large areas, multiple enemies, and having the ability to take battles to the sky, yet no slowdowns. Utilizing all Sega Saturns power having real 3D polygons unlike many other 3D titles that were released, which preferred to use layers instead¦

Bulk Slash [has a] Neo-Tokyo feel ala Neon Genesis Evangelion persona to it. You start off on mission based objectives; having them explained using 3D maps of the areas. Your mech is equipped with machine guns, grenades, a laser sword for close combat, and the ability to transform into a jet. The jet has twin machine guns and can launch six homing missiles at a time reflecting Panzer Dragoon type gameplay. With a true full-360 degree range of movement you can go anywhere on foot, and you can fly anywhere in jet mode. Powerups are everywhere, from flamethrowers, homing lasers and electric bolt grenades. Each objective is different; from destroying main targets, to protecting a ship from being destroyed. But every level has a boss encounter. Most bosses are huge, and take up most of the screen.</desc>

Following his advice, you must use your cybernetic powersuit to put out the flames in each area. Along the way you will also come across boss characters, who are out to light up the town, and you.
Your performance is then rated on your time to complete the objectives, how many lives were saved, and so forth. The better you go, the higher the rating.</desc>

		<desc>Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.

This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</desc>

The plot centers around the "spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor" - Carrigan Crittenden.  She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.

Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare "Fleshies" and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</desc>

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Criticom</name>
		<desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.

The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

Transmissions from an FWA spy reveal the location of a secret multi-national labratory deep within Siberia, the "Cyberia Complex", where a mysterious weapon is being developed. FWA leader Devlin frees a cyber-hacker named Zak from prison and sends him to infiltrate the complex and discover the true nature of the Cyberia weapon.

Unfortunately, the Cartel is also interested in the weapon and will stop at nothing to get it. Not only must Zak make his way past the Cartel forces sent to stop him, but he must also overcome the Cartel agents which have already seized control of the complex. To make matters worse the Cyberian scientist's genetically engineered creations are running rampant in the same area as the weapon, and Devlin also appears to be have something up his sleeve.</desc>

		<name>D</name>
		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<desc>FIFA 97 (also known as FIFA Soccer 97) is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football (soccer). It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.

FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.

David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.</desc>

		<name>FIFA Soccer 96</name>
		<desc>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

		<name>Arcade Gears Vol. 1 : Pu-Li-Ru-La</name>
		<desc>Pu-Li-Ru-La is a psychedelic side-scrolling arcade beat 'em up set in the magical land of Radishland. As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their "invented magic sticks" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.

Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder "boss" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.

The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes.</desc>

		<path>./Azel - Panzer Dragoon RPG (Japan) (Disc 3) (1M).cue</path>
		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

Seeing as how all the fighters have magical abilities, the fights take place in mid-air, allowing you and your opponent to fly all over the arena while you try to defeat each other using your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and super attacks (which deplete your energy bar but cause tremendous damage).

Graphics-wise the games uses 2D sprites, with colorful doll-ish designs. Gameplay modes include 1P arcade, 2P Vs mode, an art gallery featuring conceptual artwork and a story mode with selectable dialogue options that influence match difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Baku Baku Animal</name>
		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

You start with a limited number of Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy.</desc>

		<name>Baroque</name>
		<desc>The Armageddon came. A huge Heat Wave ruined the planet, humans have mutated into strange creatures who worship strange gods, trying to exterminate each other in bloody wars, and Ikei demons populate the surface of the planet. In the middle of the wasteland stands the Nerve Tower. Nobody knows what it is: the symbol of evil or the final hope for salvation, because nobody ever dared to enter it. But the hero of the game is determined to explore the tower, and perhaps to cleanse the world of evil once and for all.

"Baroque" is a survival horror adventure. The whole game is set in the tower: you slowly work your way to the top, fighting demons as you progress. You have HP as well as stamina gauge. If your stamina is depleted, you walk slower and can't react well in a battle.</desc>

		<name>Advanced V.G.</name>
		<desc>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. 

Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.</desc>

		<name>Airs Adventure</name>
		<desc>Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe. The game follows the story of an aspiring knight (default name Henry), who is framed for a crime and is about to be executed. However, the beautiful princess of the country feels mercy and stops the execution at the last moment. As the hero tries to uncover the truth about his conviction, fate brings the two together, and they begin a journey to discover distant lands in search for adventure, and perhaps even develop feelings for each other...

The game's combat is a rather simple version of the traditional Japanese-style RPG system. The player controls a party that contains only Henry and the princess. Whenever enemies are encountered, a separate battle screen appears. Commands are executed via a standard menu, allowing physical attacks, defense, as well as offensive and supporting magic spells. Graphically, Airs Adventure combines pre-rendered character sprites with partially polygonal backgrounds, with an over-the-shoulder view.</desc>

		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<name>All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas</name>
		<desc>Regardless of a sports game's features, it lives or dies by two things: play control and graphics. All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas is a good example of a feature-heavy game that has adequate play control and adequate graphics. The end result: an adequate game that lacks the polish and finesse needed to be great.

All-Star Baseball features all 30 Major League teams, including the new Tampa Bay and Arizona teams; over seven hundred real MLB players; 28 stadiums to play in; the complete 1997 schedule, including the new interleague games; player trades; and 27 category statistics from STATS, Inc. In addition, there are six modes of gameplay: exhibition, season, playoffs, all-star game, home run derby, and batting practice. In terms of features it is definitely on par with the other titles out there.</desc>

		<desc>It is Christmas of 1924, three months after Alone in the Dark. "Supernatural Private Eye" Edward Carnby and his partner Ted Stryker are investigating the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. The trail of clues leads to an old mansion named "Hell's Kitchen" - the home of an infamous gangster boss and his gang. Edward decides to pick up the trail when he learns of Ted's disappearance in the mansion. Unfortunately, Edward soon finds out that Ted has been murdered.
Carnby eventually finds out that the mobsters are the corporeal forms of the spirits of pirates that plundered the sea hundreds of years ago, the lot having sold their souls in exchange for eternal life through voodoo magic. Fighting his way into the house and ultimately onto a pirate ship hidden in the cliff on which Jack's house is built, Edward must survive, discover the secret of the pirates' apparent immortality, rescue little Grace, and find out why the pirates are so interested in her.</desc>

		<path>./Amok (Japan).cue</path>
		<name>Amok</name>
		<desc>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.

Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.

The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</desc>

		<name>Assault Rigs</name>
		<desc>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.

Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.

Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.

Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</desc>

		<name>Dennou Senki : Virtual On, Cyber Troopers</name>
		<desc>Virtual On is set up similar to a Versus fighting game. Two virtuaroids (Mecha) face each other on a stage. The player(s) use a variety of firearms, explosives, melee weapons, and other techniques to destroy the enemy for a set number of rounds, usually a single battle, or best two out of three rounds, like fighting games. The game is made to be played with a two-joystick setup, known as the twin-sticks. Each stick is equipped with a trigger and a button on top of the stick. The twin sticks control the virtuaroid on screen much like a bulldozer. Pushing or pulling both sticks in one direction makes it move in that direction, while pushing one stick forward and pulling the other back makes it turn in the forward direction. Pulling the sticks apart causes the virtuaroid to jump into the air, and automatically turn to face the opponent. Pulling them towards each other while pulling a trigger causes the virtuaroid to prone while firing.</desc>

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

Batsugun for the Saturn integrates the two revisions of the original 1993 arcade game, where the second one, Batsugun Special Version, was completed but never released because the company was bankrupt. Both versions were used to create the Saturn version by the Toaplan offshoot Gazelle. It is a military-themed vertical shooter with a choice of three weapons for the player's plane at start, with leveling-up of weapons determined by experience points, given when enemies are destroyed, rather than dropped power-ups.</desc>

It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.

The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.

Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.

Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</desc>

Throughout the world, martial arts experts are disappearing. Police from various nations are cooperating in an international manhunt to find the criminal responsible for the murders. Yet no motive has been established, and there is little evidence available. A wave of terror has struck the world, and now even the strongest and bravest of fighters are not safe.

The former contestants of the Toshinden Tournament find themselves in a world gone mad. It is not inconceivable that one of them is responsible for the current chaos. But who is behind the disappearances, and for what purpose? All of the fighters came to the Toshinden Tournament for different reasons, but they are all fighting for the same reason now: SURVIVAL.</desc>

		<name>Battle Stations</name>
		<desc>Battlestations is a title where you take control of your own fleet, ranging from patrol boats and mine layers to battleships and aircraft carriers. You'll get to pick any of the ten missions right away, all of which have a different challenge to encounter, like protecting your base from troop transports, and a mission where you'll have to prevent poachers from killing whales. You'll also get to pick from five commanders to fight against, all of which have stereotypical strengths and weaknesses. Afterwards, you'll go right to the mission, where you'll be able to navigate your ship silhouettes on a 2D, radar-esque map.</desc>

		<name>BattleSport</name>
		<desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. 

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

		<name>Bio Hazard</name>
		<desc>A team of S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) members are called to investigate a series of murders near Raccoon City.
While searching the woods near the city, the team is attacked by bloodthirsty dogs and they have to retreat to a nearby mansion. 

The player chooses between Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield and starts to explore the mansion. It soon becomes very clear that it isn't just any mansion, but a hellish place where the undead walk the corridors and other horrors are lurking in the darkness, waiting to eat some heads. While solving puzzles, collecting keys, and shooting monsters, the player has to unravel the mystery behind this mansion and, if possible, get out alive.

Exclusive to the SEGA Saturn version is a Battle Mode bonus mode, where, with limited ammo and under the threat of limited time, the player must survive a series of rooms filled with monsters</desc>

		<name>Actua Soccer</name>
		<desc>In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.

Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top. A full range of customised tournaments were available, as well as multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.</desc>

With very large areas, multiple enemies, and having the ability to take battles to the sky, yet no slowdowns. Utilizing all Sega Saturns power having real 3D polygons unlike many other 3D titles that were released, which preferred to use layers instead¦

Bulk Slash [has a] Neo-Tokyo feel ala Neon Genesis Evangelion persona to it. You start off on mission based objectives; having them explained using 3D maps of the areas. Your mech is equipped with machine guns, grenades, a laser sword for close combat, and the ability to transform into a jet. The jet has twin machine guns and can launch six homing missiles at a time reflecting Panzer Dragoon type gameplay. With a true full-360 degree range of movement you can go anywhere on foot, and you can fly anywhere in jet mode. Powerups are everywhere, from flamethrowers, homing lasers and electric bolt grenades. Each objective is different; from destroying main targets, to protecting a ship from being destroyed. But every level has a boss encounter. Most bosses are huge, and take up most of the screen.</desc>

During each level, your quad leader informs you of the critical areas inside certain buildings, such as multi-level warehouses.
Following his advice, you must use your cybernetic powersuit to put out the flames in each area. Along the way you will also come across boss characters, who are out to light up the town, and you.
Your performance is then rated on your time to complete the objectives, how many lives were saved, and so forth. The better you go, the higher the rating.</desc>

		<desc>Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.

This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</desc>

The plot centers around the "spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor" - Carrigan Crittenden.  She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.

Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare "Fleshies" and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</desc>

		<name>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams...</name>
		<desc>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams is a one level themed "demo" of NiGHTS into Dreams. It was originally released in November 1996 for the Sega Saturn.
Due to its freebie nature, Christmas NiGHTS is a much smaller game than NiGHTS into Dreams - there is only one level (Spring Valley - almost identical to the level seen in regular NiGHTS) however unlike the original it is playable as Elliot as well as Claris. When playing as Elliot the stage is mirrored.
Christmas NiGHTS is Christmas-themed, and so its graphics and music have been replaced with winter-esque versions of the original stage (but only in winter). For example, Ideya Captures are now giant floating Christmas trees, and NiGHTS wears red attire rather than purple. Gameplay is largely identical to the original game, including the A-Life system altered by defeating enemies.</desc>

		<name>Clockwork Knight : Pepperouchau's Adventure</name>
		<desc>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.

The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.

Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</desc>

		<name>Command &amp; Conquer</name>
		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Criticom</name>
		<desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.

The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

		<desc>Batsugun was the last release from the arcade game development studio Toaplan and one of the earliest if not the earliest manic or "bullet hell" shoot-'em-ups. A large part of the team later went on to work at CAVE Co., Ltd. where the genre would be refined.

Batsugun for the Saturn integrates the two revisions of the original 1993 arcade game, where the second one, Batsugun Special Version, was completed but never released because the company was bankrupt. Both versions were used to create the Saturn version by the Toaplan offshoot Gazelle. It is a military-themed vertical shooter with a choice of three weapons for the player's plane at start, with leveling-up of weapons determined by experience points, given when enemies are destroyed, rather than dropped power-ups.</desc>

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden Remix</name>
		<desc>Toshinden Remix or Toshinden S as it was called in Japan is a port of Takara's Playstation fighting game Battle Arena Toshinden to the Sega Saturn by Sega.

It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.

The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.

Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.

Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</desc>

		<desc>The Toshinden Tournament is over. Through the battles some of the fighters have uncovered much about the shadowy events surrounding their lives. But the others now head home with little more than a few bruises and unfulfilled dreams. None of them, however, are aware that a new battle is about to begin.

Throughout the world, martial arts experts are disappearing. Police from various nations are cooperating in an international manhunt to find the criminal responsible for the murders. Yet no motive has been established, and there is little evidence available. A wave of terror has struck the world, and now even the strongest and bravest of fighters are not safe.

The former contestants of the Toshinden Tournament find themselves in a world gone mad. It is not inconceivable that one of them is responsible for the current chaos. But who is behind the disappearances, and for what purpose? All of the fighters came to the Toshinden Tournament for different reasons, but they are all fighting for the same reason now: SURVIVAL.</desc>

Players can also earn points through this action as well as from winning races to upgrade their car and go head-to-head against the computer or against three CPU opponents.

Keiichi Tsuchiya, a racing champion from Tokyo and Masaaki Bando, a top automotive expert from Japan both lent their expertise to the game to ensure authentic handling and physics for each vehicle that was rendered in the game.</desc>

		<name>BattleSport</name>
		<desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. 

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

		<name>Black Matrix</name>
		<desc>The cosmic battle between angels and demons ended in the demons' victory. They took control of the world and reversed the ideology of the angels to suit their own demonic nature. The most positive and beautiful emotions belonged to the seven mortal sins. Angels were deprived of their rights and had to exist as slaves, obeying their demon masters in everything. You play an angel named Abel. In the beginning, you choose your master from several available characters. Your master, however, is soon accused of love - one of the seven greatest sins. You have to escape from prison, where you were thrown shortly after your master was banned, and to find a way to save your master.

"Black/Matrix" is a strategy RPG that is divided into large battles and story sequences. You fight in turn-based mode by moving your party members on an isometric battle field, attacking and using magic, for which you require blood of defeated enemies. The experience points you gather after the battle can then be divided among your party members the way you like.</desc>

A nuclear shockwave has all but destroyed the entire population of Earth. The remaining humans on the planet were gathered aboard a ship called the Ark by a prophetic man named Noa. After the radiation dissipated, humankind emerged from the Ark and began building thriving civilizations.

However, the fledgling civilization came under attack by a culture called Gorn. Gorn was a culture consisting of the embodiment of machines and artificiality. During the nuclear winter, Gorn was sealed beneath the Earth's crust and emerged when the remaining humans came out of the Ark. Humanity must fight back against Gorn, using ancient weapons unearthed by the new civilization and two "Ultimate Destroyers" known as Kyo and Forn.</desc>

		<name>Blue Breaker : Ken yori mo Hohoemi o</name>
		<desc>The world of Blue Breaker is called "the path in the middle of empty sky": floating islands connected with each other by bridges. It is the tradition of the people in this world that a fighter's full initiation can be completed only when he finds his true love and marries her. Such day has come now in the life of a young warrior named Kain, the hero of the game. His father explains to him that besides the usual warrior's goal of defeating the evil Dark Lord, Kain also has to find the girl of his dreams. He introduces to him a young sorceress named Asha, who becomes his first companion. But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!

Labeled as Love Role-Playing, "Blue Breaker" is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with "love adventure", in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. "Blue Breaker" features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on. It is also important to form a party in which the girls will have as few internal conflicts with each other as possible.</desc>

		<name>Angelique Special 2</name>
		<desc>Following the events of the first Angelique game, Angelique Limoges has become the queen of Cosmos, and her former rival Rosalie - her aid. Now a whole new Cosmos has appeared, and it's time to choose a new queen for it. The candidates this time are Angelique Collet (the protagonist of the game) and Rachel Hart.
The gameplay system remains largely unchanged in this sequel. Once again, Angelique has to use diplomacy to make the Nine Guardians lend her their powers (making the inhabitants of her land happy), or develop stronger feelings for her. New in this sequel is the ability to work with three different instructors, developing mind, sense, or dignity of the heroine, which will influence the way she interacts with other characters and also affect the behavior of the Guardians.</desc>

		<name>Arcade Gears Vol. 1 : Pu-Li-Ru-La</name>
		<desc>Pu-Li-Ru-La is a psychedelic side-scrolling arcade beat 'em up set in the magical land of Radishland. As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their "invented magic sticks" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.

Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder "boss" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.

The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes.</desc>

Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.

As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</desc>

		<path>./Assault Rigs (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Assault Rigs</name>
		<desc>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.

Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.

Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.

Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</desc>

		<name>Astra Superstars</name>
		<desc>A one-on-one 2D fighting game, Astra Superstars pits all the champions of the magical kingdom against each other in a series of 3-round fights to earn the right to challenge the evil Satan Volte and try to put an end to his reign of terror.

Seeing as how all the fighters have magical abilities, the fights take place in mid-air, allowing you and your opponent to fly all over the arena while you try to defeat each other using your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and super attacks (which deplete your energy bar but cause tremendous damage).

Graphics-wise the games uses 2D sprites, with colorful doll-ish designs. Gameplay modes include 1P arcade, 2P Vs mode, an art gallery featuring conceptual artwork and a story mode with selectable dialogue options that influence match difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.

Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top. A full range of customised tournaments were available, as well as multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Trilogy (Europe) (En,Fr,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<desc>Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order. 

Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. 
In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman Wars is a video game in the Bomberman series released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on April 16, 1998. The main character is King Bomber who rules over his kingdom. The object of the game is to conquer all the pieces of the Bomber country. Eventually you fight the main villain, Bagular, and his four henchmen.

This is one of the earliest games in the Bomberman series to stray away from its party game roots and focus more on the single player component (though it did have a VS mode). It is the third Bomberman game for the Saturn, and the second for the PlayStation.</desc>

		<name>Command &amp; Conquer</name>
		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Criticom : The Critical Combat</name>
		<desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.

The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. 

Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.</desc>

		<name>Airs Adventure</name>
		<desc>Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe. The game follows the story of an aspiring knight (default name Henry), who is framed for a crime and is about to be executed. However, the beautiful princess of the country feels mercy and stops the execution at the last moment. As the hero tries to uncover the truth about his conviction, fate brings the two together, and they begin a journey to discover distant lands in search for adventure, and perhaps even develop feelings for each other...

The game's combat is a rather simple version of the traditional Japanese-style RPG system. The player controls a party that contains only Henry and the princess. Whenever enemies are encountered, a separate battle screen appears. Commands are executed via a standard menu, allowing physical attacks, defense, as well as offensive and supporting magic spells. Graphically, Airs Adventure combines pre-rendered character sprites with partially polygonal backgrounds, with an over-the-shoulder view.</desc>

		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<desc>Regardless of a sports game's features, it lives or dies by two things: play control and graphics. All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas is a good example of a feature-heavy game that has adequate play control and adequate graphics. The end result: an adequate game that lacks the polish and finesse needed to be great.

All-Star Baseball features all 30 Major League teams, including the new Tampa Bay and Arizona teams; over seven hundred real MLB players; 28 stadiums to play in; the complete 1997 schedule, including the new interleague games; player trades; and 27 category statistics from STATS, Inc. In addition, there are six modes of gameplay: exhibition, season, playoffs, all-star game, home run derby, and batting practice. In terms of features it is definitely on par with the other titles out there.</desc>

The trail of clues leads to an old mansion named "Hell's Kitchen" - the home of an infamous gangster boss and his gang. Edward decides to pick up the trail when he learns of Ted's disappearance in the mansion. Unfortunately, Edward soon finds out that Ted has been murdered.
Carnby eventually finds out that the mobsters are the corporeal forms of the spirits of pirates that plundered the sea hundreds of years ago, the lot having sold their souls in exchange for eternal life through voodoo magic. Fighting his way into the house and ultimately onto a pirate ship hidden in the cliff on which Jack's house is built, Edward must survive, discover the secret of the pirates' apparent immortality, rescue little Grace, and find out why the pirates are so interested in her.</desc>

		<path>./Amok (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Amok</name>
		<desc>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.

Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.

The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</desc>

		<name>Amok</name>
		<desc>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.

Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.

The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other.

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<name>Azel : Panzer Dragoon RPG</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<name>Baku Baku Animal : Sekai Shiiku Gakari Senshuken</name>
		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

		<desc>The Armageddon came. A huge Heat Wave ruined the planet, humans have mutated into strange creatures who worship strange gods, trying to exterminate each other in bloody wars, and Ikei demons populate the surface of the planet. In the middle of the wasteland stands the Nerve Tower. Nobody knows what it is: the symbol of evil or the final hope for salvation, because nobody ever dared to enter it. But the hero of the game is determined to explore the tower, and perhaps to cleanse the world of evil once and for all.

"Baroque" is a survival horror adventure. The whole game is set in the tower: you slowly work your way to the top, fighting demons as you progress. You have HP as well as stamina gauge. If your stamina is depleted, you walk slower and can't react well in a battle.</desc>

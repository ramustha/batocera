		<name>HOCKEY</name>
		<desc>THIS GAME, AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, IS A HOCKEY SIMULATION WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO MARIO LEMIEUX HOCKEY. THERE ARE 22 TEAMS TO CHOOSE FROM WHICH ARE BASED ON THE NHL 91 LINE UP THOUGH THEY CAN BE CHANGED IF THE PLAYER WISHES. YOU CONTROL 1 PLAYER AT A TIME AND THE CPU CONTROLS THE REST OF YOUR TEAM THOUGH YOU CAN SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT PLAYER AT ANY TIME IF THE NEED ARISES. THERE IS ALSO A FIGHT PENALTY SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONTINUALLY PUNCH THE AN OPPONENT IN ORDER TO PROCEED. THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE AS IF YOU WERE SAT IN ONE OF THE CROWD SEATS.</desc>

This is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at them - in some cases they will need ramming off the road.  There are also hardened criminals to catch - if you can get one of these to confess, your day's work is considered done.

The game's action is presented with an overhead view of your squad car. Car upgrades are available, to be brought from your reward money. You earn Demerits by crashing, wrongly arresting innocents, or failing to meet your quota. Too many demerits and it is game over.</desc>

The mayor figured that a friendly game of hoops would be a much more peaceful way to settle disputes. He was wrong.

You can choose 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 game modes. There are six characters to choose from (ten in Atari Lynx version); each with their own health, speed, and power attributes. Each player without the ball can jump to block a shot or punch there opponent to get the ball. There's also an option to perform a power throw on an opposing player. Players with the ball can shoot or pass. Power ups appear on the court at random instances. These power up one attribute for the player. For example, the lightning power up increases the player's speed. 

The referee does not call fouls, but does hurl knives at the players.</desc>

Batman must move through four levels on his quest to stop the Penguin and Catwoman. Enemies trying to stop him include circus clowns on the streets, policemen (whom Catwoman put on his trail) on the roofs of Gotham City, and penguin commandos in the sewers and the Penguin's lair.
Batman can beat them up with his fists or destroy them using Batarangs and acid vials (which must be collected first). Several of the levels end in boss encounters with the two main villains, while in the last level, Batman must also save industrialist Max Shreck from the Penguin's wrath before finishing him off.</desc>

The game is an update on the classic arcade game Battlezone and stays true to the original in terms of gameplay. The gameplay involves you driving round a landscape destroying enemy tanks and U.F.O.s  whilst trying not to run out of fuel and also not getting destroyed yourself though luckily there are fuel pick-ups and power-ups to collect. You can also use the credits earned for completing missions to upgrade your tank. There are also a few different tanks to choose from including the Rhino which is heavily armoured but runs out of fuel faster than the other tanks.</desc>

		<path>./Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure.zip</path>
		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</name>
		<desc>The Lynx title based on the Keanu Reeves/Alex Winter film franchise actually takes place after the second film, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their "medieval babe" girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history.  Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.

Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor.  Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo.  If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.

Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future.  Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that "they" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.

A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.</desc>

While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble.

You move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal "Burst!!!", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is "Use scanner". This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles. Once you locate and gather all the particles needed in the level, you move on to the next level. After you finish five levels, you win the game.</desc>

However, in the near future, the explanation is that she's been kidnapped by a Criminal Brain robot, and held in a booby-trapped lair. As the advanced hybrid Electrocop, your task is to rescue her within an hour.

Gameplay involves working your way through the complex warehouse maze, unlocking coded door along the way. Extra weapons can be collected to help dealing with the drones. There are also computer terminals to buy new weapons - these also have simple subgames built in. What makes the game unique, and intended as a showpiece for the Lynx hardware, is that full 3D is used, so that the character walks in and out of the screen as well as across it.</desc>

Some aliens will join you when shot (power-ups).  Alien bases in each area allow you to repair your weapons and shield, but landing at the wrong time will cause your ship to explode and lose all power-ups.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

		<desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<path>./Loopz.zip</path>
		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<path>./Power Factor.zip</path>
		<name>Power Factor</name>
		<desc>Power Factor is an action-platformer starring the single campily-named hero, Redd Ace, fighting alien creatures known as the Ceegarians from the Ceeg dimension.  Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as "transdimensional intruders," and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading "Sinlendo Techmods."  

The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components.  The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, "our dimension's reactor."  As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine.  To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you’re meandering through this simulator on the “famous Atarian Leisure Moon.”  

Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze à la Metroid.  However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited.  Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.

Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the "Tmat MOW."  Tmat MOW is intended to be short for “TRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.”  Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard.  Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like.  Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons.  Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected.  As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots.  Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned.  Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.

Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them.  Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight.  Tapping "up" on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding "up" activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly.  Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn't a luxury to be wasted.  When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.

Pressing the "Option 2" button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons.  If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.

The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues.  There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard—which may be selected prior to gameplay.</desc>

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</desc>

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<name>S.t.u.n. Runner</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Of The Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of many computer versions.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

There are 12 missions in total, each of which requires you to destroy targets in a set time limit. There are also training and head-to-head (against a CPU-controlled drone) modes. 

You have a limited number of automatically-targeting missiles as well as a cannon. A tracking map tells you where you are on the level, and where the enemies are.Contact with the ground, mountains or other vehicles will damage or destroy your helicopter.</desc>

Unlike Chip's Challenge, the game plays in realtime and you can pick up and use weapons to keep away certain monsters as you paint the tiles.  There is also a shop you can enter to purchase items.  Finally, levels have a time limit for completion.</desc>

		<path>./T-Tris.zip</path>
		<name>T-Tris</name>
		<desc>It plays like most Tetris games. Pressing down throws down the blocks, and so does pressing A which is quite annoying until you get used to it. The B button rotates the blocks, but as in a few other Tetris games you can't rotate once your block is pressed against the wall. It's a bit tedious to move, holding left or right moves you in that direction but very slowly, to speed it up you have to tap left or right which gets harder the faster it gets..

You have the option to start the game on various levels, it shows you how much time has passed, how many lines you've cleared, the points, level, high score and how many players. It apparently has a multiplayer function, I haven't tried this out yet, I don't have the Comlynx cable and I'm not sure whether it demands several copies of the game or not.. On the right side of the screen you see how many of each type of block you've received, at the bottom it reads ?PREV? which my brain wants to interpret to ?Previous?, but it probably stands for ?Preview?. It shows the next block either way, and it's quite annoying since I'm used to having that one on the top, so every time I glanced to see what was next I kept seeing that same top block XD
There's no music, only some sound effects and a very German voice saying ?Oh toll!? (which translates to ?Oh cool?) when you do something good XD It gets almost impossible when you go above level 9, it's so slow to  move the blocks left or right and they kind of stick as soon as they touch another block.. but I'm still happy to have a Tetris game for the Atari Lynx!! Thanks Bastion for creating this ^_^</desc>

		<desc>While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a planet covered entirely in slime.  You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out.  The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas.  Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first.  Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.

The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</desc>

The game closely resembled Sega's Wonder Boy in Monster Land, as certain elements like collecting hidden gold, upgrading the character's weapons and visiting shops were practically identical, despite the difference in release times.

Programming of the Lead version (Atari ST version) was done by Mark Fisher (a.k.a. Fish, Mr Fish) Original graphics were created by Anthony Rosbottom (a.k.a. Bliz, Blizzard) Music was written by Barry Leitch &amp; Ian Howe</desc>

		<desc>In a desperate attempt to stop inner-city gang wars, the city leaders organized a basketball league.  The league is scheduled to play on three courts: a street, a junkyard, and a rooftop.  The mayor figured that a friendly game of hoops would be a much more peaceful way to settle disputes. He was wrong.

You can choose 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 game modes. There are six characters to choose from (ten in Atari Lynx version); each with their own health, speed, and power attributes. Each player without the ball can jump to block a shot or punch there opponent to get the ball. There's also an option to perform a power throw on an opposing player. Players with the ball can shoot or pass. Power ups appear on the court at random instances. These power up one attribute for the player. For example, the lightning power up increases the player's speed. 

The referee does not call fouls, but does hurl knives at the players.</desc>

		<desc>Atari themselves adapted the 1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns for their Lynx handheld as a side-scrolling beat'em'up.

Batman must move through four levels on his quest to stop the Penguin and Catwoman. Enemies trying to stop him include circus clowns on the streets, policemen (whom Catwoman put on his trail) on the roofs of Gotham City, and penguin commandos in the sewers and the Penguin's lair.
Batman can beat them up with his fists or destroy them using Batarangs and acid vials (which must be collected first). Several of the levels end in boss encounters with the two main villains, while in the last level, Batman must also save industrialist Max Shreck from the Penguin's wrath before finishing him off.</desc>

The game is an update on the classic arcade game Battlezone and stays true to the original in terms of gameplay. The gameplay involves you driving round a landscape destroying enemy tanks and U.F.O.s  whilst trying not to run out of fuel and also not getting destroyed yourself though luckily there are fuel pick-ups and power-ups to collect. You can also use the credits earned for completing missions to upgrade your tank. There are also a few different tanks to choose from including the Rhino which is heavily armoured but runs out of fuel faster than the other tanks.</desc>

		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</name>
		<desc>The Lynx title based on the Keanu Reeves/Alex Winter film franchise actually takes place after the second film, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their "medieval babe" girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history.  Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.

Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor.  Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo.  If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.

Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future.  Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that "they" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.

A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.</desc>

		<desc>You are Travis, a scientist doing experiments with dense matter for the creation of artificial black holes for interstellar travel. While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble.

You move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal "Burst!!!", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is "Use scanner". This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles. Once you locate and gather all the particles needed in the level, you move on to the next level. After you finish five levels, you win the game.</desc>

		<desc>Today, if a daughter of the President goes missing, I would look in the nearest bar. However, in the near future, the explanation is that she's been kidnapped by a Criminal Brain robot, and held in a booby-trapped lair. As the advanced hybrid Electrocop, your task is to rescue her within an hour.

Gameplay involves working your way through the complex warehouse maze, unlocking coded door along the way. Extra weapons can be collected to help dealing with the drones. There are also computer terminals to buy new weapons - these also have simple subgames built in. What makes the game unique, and intended as a showpiece for the Lynx hardware, is that full 3D is used, so that the character walks in and out of the screen as well as across it.</desc>

Gates of Zendocon is a side-scrolling shooter very similar to the original arcade shooter of this type, Scramble.  Unlike Scramble, there are 51 game areas in total, but the player fights through a subset of them through branches, choosing the next area to visit.  

Some aliens will join you when shot (power-ups).  Alien bases in each area allow you to repair your weapons and shield, but landing at the wrong time will cause your ship to explode and lose all power-ups.</desc>

It introduced new character classes like ?Nerd? or ?Punkrocker? and was one of a few games that used the ?vertical mode? of the Atari Lynx, another being the port of Klax. The story: a crystal falls from the sky and lands in a castle, and it must be retrieved from within its 40 mazes type area. A year later U.S. Gold and Tengen would release another completely different game called Gauntlet III: The Final Quest.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

You control 1 player at a time and the CPU controls the rest of your team though you can switch to a different player at any time if the need arises. There is also a fight penalty system where you have to continually punch the an opponent in order to proceed.

		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

		<desc>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop.All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A)? Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about Loopz. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will Loopz drive you crazy? You bet!</desc>

		<desc>This game was a part of a promotion from Marlboro cigarettes where you could exchange points from cigarette packets for Marlboro branded items. The game came with a red Atari Lynx with 'Marlboro Abenteuer Team' branding written across the top.

The game doesn't appear to be very complete, featuring only one track. It was released on a hand-etched PCB cartridge that was individually numbered.

Note: Sometimes this pops up as 'Marlboro Man' and on a green PCB cartridge - these versions are fake reproductions, not the originals produced for the Marlboro competition.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<path>./Power Factor.zip</path>
		<name>Power Factor</name>
		<desc>Power Factor is an action-platformer starring the single campily-named hero, Redd Ace, fighting alien creatures known as the Ceegarians from the Ceeg dimension.  Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as "transdimensional intruders," and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading "Sinlendo Techmods."  

The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components.  The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, "our dimension's reactor."  As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine.  To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you’re meandering through this simulator on the “famous Atarian Leisure Moon.”  

Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze à la Metroid.  However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited.  Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.

Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the "Tmat MOW."  Tmat MOW is intended to be short for “TRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.”  Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard.  Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like.  Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons.  Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected.  As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots.  Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned.  Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.

Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them.  Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight.  Tapping "up" on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding "up" activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly.  Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn't a luxury to be wasted.  When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.

Pressing the "Option 2" button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons.  If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.

The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues.  There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard—which may be selected prior to gameplay.</desc>

Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<desc>An evil being known as Ligar is about to conquer the land of Argool. Such is his power that no living creature dares to cross paths with him. But the legendary warrior Rygar rises from his grave to restore peace and justice. Armed with his famed weapon Diskarmor, Rygar begins to traverse the vast lands that lead to the lair of the demon, as his minions are trying in vain to stop him...

Originally released on the arcades, Rygar is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls the titular hero, advancing through stages populated by hostile creatures. Beside the Diskarmor, a weapon that looks like a shield with a chain attached to it, the hero can use a variety of other weapons, including projectiles that can be fired in four directions. Various "powers" are scattered through the levels and can be collected. The effects of these powers include increasing the fire power of the equipped weapon, adding time to the clock, temporary invisibility, extra points, etc.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Of The Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of many computer versions.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

There are 12 missions in total, each of which requires you to destroy targets in a set time limit. There are also training and head-to-head (against a CPU-controlled drone) modes. 

You have a limited number of automatically-targeting missiles as well as a cannon. A tracking map tells you where you are on the level, and where the enemies are.Contact with the ground, mountains or other vehicles will damage or destroy your helicopter.</desc>

		<name>S.t.u.n. Runner</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</desc>

		<name>T-Tris</name>
		<desc>It plays like most Tetris games. Pressing down throws down the blocks, and so does pressing A which is quite annoying until you get used to it. The B button rotates the blocks, but as in a few other Tetris games you can't rotate once your block is pressed against the wall. It's a bit tedious to move, holding left or right moves you in that direction but very slowly, to speed it up you have to tap left or right which gets harder the faster it gets..

You have the option to start the game on various levels, it shows you how much time has passed, how many lines you've cleared, the points, level, high score and how many players. It apparently has a multiplayer function, I haven't tried this out yet, I don't have the Comlynx cable and I'm not sure whether it demands several copies of the game or not.. On the right side of the screen you see how many of each type of block you've received, at the bottom it reads ?PREV? which my brain wants to interpret to ?Previous?, but it probably stands for ?Preview?. It shows the next block either way, and it's quite annoying since I'm used to having that one on the top, so every time I glanced to see what was next I kept seeing that same top block XD
There's no music, only some sound effects and a very German voice saying ?Oh toll!? (which translates to ?Oh cool?) when you do something good XD It gets almost impossible when you go above level 9, it's so slow to  move the blocks left or right and they kind of stick as soon as they touch another block.. but I'm still happy to have a Tetris game for the Atari Lynx!! Thanks Bastion for creating this ^_^</desc>

You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out.  The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas.  Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first.  Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.

The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</desc>

The game closely resembled Sega's Wonder Boy in Monster Land, as certain elements like collecting hidden gold, upgrading the character's weapons and visiting shops were practically identical, despite the difference in release times.

Programming of the Lead version (Atari ST version) was done by Mark Fisher (a.k.a. Fish, Mr Fish) Original graphics were created by Anthony Rosbottom (a.k.a. Bliz, Blizzard) Music was written by Barry Leitch &amp; Ian Howe</desc>

		<name>Warbirds</name>
		<desc>A combat flight action/simulation with colorful graphics and pretty straight-forward gameplay.

Step inside the cockpit of a World War I plane, when there were no sophisticated weaponry, and try to gun down the enemy. Simple as that.

The graphics were faux-3D, as the planes were 2D sprites (natural, considering the release date), but the sky seemed very vast and you could fly around freely.</desc>

		<desc>World Class Soccer is a soccer video game. Computer Gaming World criticized the game for only displaying about 10% of the field at a time without a radar screen to show the rest, but liked the animation. The magazine concluded that "World Class Soccer should prove an informative and reasonably entertaining way to prepare for the event".</desc>

		<name>Xenophobe</name>
		<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<path>./Xybots.zip</path>
		<name>Xybots</name>
		<desc>Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</desc>

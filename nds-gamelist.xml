		<name>Super Monkey Ball: Touch &amp; Roll</name>
		<desc>Those cute little monkey's rolling around in their bubble like balls have returned for their latest adventure, this time taking advantage of the Nintendo DS touch screen/stylus combo to provide a new level of control over your Super Monkey Ball!

As with the previous titles in the series, your aim is to guide your monkey across a number of different obstacle courses, reaching the goal before the time limit expires. You control not the monkey, but the play field itself, tilting it back and forth to dodge barriers and collect bananas.

Along with challenge, practice and replay modes, Touch and Roll allows for four players to compete against each other. You'll also be able to play in a set of bonus games, such as Monkey Mini-Golf, Monkey Fight and Monkey Bowling. Two new game modes, exclusive to the DS rendition, are Monkey Wars (a 1st person style shoot 'em up) and Monkey Air Hockey which, as the name suggests, is a Super Monkey Ball take on the arcade Air Hockey table top game.</desc>

		<name>Elite Beat Agents</name>
		<desc>Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song. 

The game is played entirely through use of the stylus.  Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song.  Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a set line area until the end of a beat.  Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible during a music break.

The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic with her son.  Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.

Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.</desc>

		<name>Magical Starsign</name>
		<desc>Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O’ Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.

The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay. 

As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective. 

There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Trigger</name>
		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

		<path>./Platinum Sudoku.zip</path>
		<name>Platinum Sudoku</name>
		<desc>Platinum Sudoku offers 20 million Sudoku puzzles (in five levels of difficulty), over 300 Kakuro puzzles and a number of mini-games. The game starts with a tutorial mode and the twenty million puzzles will only be available to you after completing 100 puzzles in Easy, Medium or Hard mode. Solving all puzzles in Hard mode unlocks the Pro mode, solving the Pro puzzles unlocks the Sudoku X mode. New background graphics, fonts, grid styles and music are also unlockable.

The object of Sudoku is to fill a square grid measuring 9x9 spaces, further divided into nine 3x3 squares with the numbers 1 to 9. Each horizontal row and each vertical column can only contain each number once, and this also applies to each of the square grids. Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of difficulty. The game layout can be switched around for left-handed players by choosing an option from the menu.

Filling the grid is done by either drawing the desired character directly onto the grid on the Touch Screen, by pointing to that number on a small grid or by using the D-pad. Several numbers can be entered in one cell in Draft mode. When the player has deduced which number is the only one possible, the choice is made definitive. It is possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong. It is also possible to choose several assisting features from the game menu, for instance highlighting the current row or column, highlighting the "easiest to solve" cells or automatically filling the grid with all possibilities for each cell.

Kakuro puzzles are like crosswords except the grids are filled with numbers. The grid consists of black and white cells. The white cells must be filled with numbers, the black cells contain the clues. Each entry can only contain a number (between 0 and 9) once and the sum of the numbers must match the clue. For example if the clue is "11" and the entry is three cells wide, the solution could be "1, 6, 4" or "2, 5, 4" but not "2, 7, 2".  

The mini-games included in Platinum Sudoku are Subtract (drop numbers unto others to subtract them until you reach zero), Pair Match (draw lines between pairs of numbers), Shuffle (slider puzzle), Choice Block (find the missing number), High Sum (choose the block with the highest sum) and Mine Detector (mine sweeper). If a challenge is met, the game is unlocked in the menu and you can try to improve your high score.

Two players can play co-op to solve a grid together or compete to see who is the fastest in solving a grid. Finally there is a Custom Grid mode which allows you to design your own puzzles.</desc>

		<path>./Etrian Odyssey.zip</path>
		<name>Etrian Odyssey</name>
		<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

		<desc>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</desc>

Adjectives can change the color, size, elements, behaviors and many other aspects of the object they are describing.

? Universal Feedback System: Visualize progress throughout each level! Relevant objects summoned get a thumb up, while irrelevant objects get a thumb down.
? Updated Dictionary: Summon more than 800 all-new, customizable objects to solve puzzles and earn Starites.
? New Control Schemes: Control Maxwell with the D-pad or with updated and more precise new Stylus controls! Weight, buoyancy, friction have all been reworked to make objects interact better to the player's input and reflect any adjective that is applied to an object.
? New Level Editor: Create both puzzle and action levels to build your very own custom playground. The unique new template system allows players to create all kinds of objectives for their levels with ease.

? Innovative UI: An exciting new UI gives players more control over gameplay, with more detail on how to navigate through new levels in the game.</desc>

		<name>Orcs &amp; Elves</name>
		<desc>Orcs &amp; Elves is a turn-based role-playing game based on improved DOOM RPG engine. The story follows an elf named Elli who, along with a talking magic wand Ellon, heads to the depths of a devastated dwarven citadel to find out what happened there, battling foes of many kinds, finding mysterious items and meeting various people.

The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series; the player can only move between squares, forward, backward, strafe left or right, turn in 90 degree increments. Enemies and dungeon features are drawn with sprite graphics. There are some 3D objects in the dungeons as well, and the game employs some 3D camera movements in the cutscenes. The dungeons mostly consist of one level, though it is possible to move between different parts of the dungeons and revisit the previous dungeons as necessary.</desc>

		<name>Infinite Space</name>
		<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

		<name>LEGO The Lord of the Rings</name>
		<desc>The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron.

Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor).

Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with the Extras menu.

While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly approach as the home console versions.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds himself lost and alone in unknown seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touch-screen controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass offers new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy Link the minutes he'll need to survive.

Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra and his way back to the seas he once knew.</desc>

		<name>Inazuma Eleven</name>
		<desc>Inazuma Eleven is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and well-known player ? Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason, don't want the club to exist.

The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus. All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action. These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills.

As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.</desc>

It's been nearly a generation since the Raposa have been in contact with the Creator, and most assume he's left them to take care of themselves.  Still, the time has passed peacefully, and the Raposa lived in relative happiness and comfort.

However, the Book of Life has been stolen, and a madman has been reshaping the world according to his own whims.  Most of the Raposa have moved away, looking for safer lands, and those who remain plead for the Creator to return and save them from the darkness, which has crept across their village.  

As the Creator, your job is to rebuild your fragmented world, and recover the now missing pages of the Book of Life.  Use your stylus and draw your own hero to platform his way to saving the Raposa's world. Along the way, draw your own platforms, vehicles, and all manner of other things. It's up to you to bring color back into the darkened landscape.

The player's character can be drawn for various elements such as torso, head, arms and legs with different color schemes. In the village shop, games, songs, patterns and moves can be bought to travel through the world with 2D-platformer gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Contact</name>
		<desc>A professor in a search for intelligent life makes contact...with you.  Communicating with him through the Nintendo DS, he asks for your help!  He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

Contact is an adventure game with a difference.  The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not.  You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him.  Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently.  Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase.  Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits.  Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.

The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.</desc>

		<name>Touch Detective</name>
		<desc>After young Mackenzie's father died suddenly, she inherited the family detective agency.  Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective.  She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.

Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6.  Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move.  Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like.  Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective.  Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.

The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself.  As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that?  I wasn't listening!").  It can be interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.

Touch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle.  After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case.  In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.</desc>

		<desc>A second retelling of the original Fire Emblem on the Famicom, Shadow Dragon utilises the Nintendo DS online options in a first for the long running Fire Emblem series. 

The game offers a graphical enhancement from Ankoku Ry? to Hikari no Ken and Monsh? no Nazo, which was the first remake of the original, as well as utilising the dual screens on the Nintendo DS to display the action and character stats simultaneously.

The main story centres on prince Marth as he embarks on a quest to reconquer his home kingdom and rescue his kidnapped sister. Characters and chapters that were not present in the original have been introduced in this version, as well as some that were omitted for Fire Emblem: Monsh? no Nazo. Over twenty character classes are included in the game as well as over fifty individual characters to aid Marth.

Also included is the ability to save mid battle on special save point so a mistake in the last turn will not force a restart. Other features are the class swap for characters to change their abilities. Online battle features up to five characters per side in a two player battle.</desc>

		<desc>In this throwback to the early days of CRPGs you must explore the Dark Spire dungeon with a party of up to four characters.

Party creation is basic by most modern standards. 
Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what your character is.

These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.</desc>

		<path>./Deep Labyrinth.zip</path>
		<name>Deep Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the game’s attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinth’s magic system requires the player to draw symbols – Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.

The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.

In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As it’s getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet – dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out – Shawn’s parents’ memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.

The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.

The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.</desc>

		<desc>Time Hollow is an interactive novel in the vein of games like Phoenix Wright where the player talks to characters and examine areas to find clues and items to help them in their quest.
The story takes place with the player taking control of a young man by the name of Ethan Kairos, who discovers that his family has mysteriously disappeared and sets off to find them. He then comes across a strange looking hollow pen and acquires it where he learns its unique and magical property: the ability to open portals to the past. Using this pen, the player will take Ethan to the past in search of clues for his family and hopefully prevent the awful tragedy.
The gameplay mostly consists of exploring areas, searching for clues and items and encountering a plethora of different characters that can be talked to.</desc>

For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog.

		<name>Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs</name>
		<desc>In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes.  Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to investigate.  However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left stranded on an island.  There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers.  Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the Oblivia region?

Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series.  As with the previous games, you move your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture styler" (represented by the stylus).  To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.  Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees, extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon.  Near the start of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist.  If you tap it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen which weaken enemies.

A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver.  These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps).  To summon these Pokémon, you must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky can be seen.

After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions.  These missions can be played with up to four players, and Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly.  This is a great help as each mission must be completed within a certain time for it to be a success.  Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more difficult this way.  You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health and speed.</desc>

		<path>./Soul Bubbles.zip</path>
		<name>Soul Bubbles</name>
		<desc>Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting them in bubbles to the exit of each level.

The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.

But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the Dead.

To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow triangles if there is imminent danger.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

The letter mentions that Schrader has acquired an elusive artifact called the Elysian Box - legend has it that anyone who tries to open it dies.  The pair rush to Schrader's apartment, but it is too late - the box appears to have claimed another victim, and yet is missing.  The only clue is a ticket for the luxurious Molentary Express, found in the apartment.  Will Layton and Luke be able to solve this latest mystery?

Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is the sequel to Professor Layton and the Curious Village, taking place directly after the events of the first game.  Players take the role of the titular professor and his assistant Luke as they explore the Molentary Express for clues to the mystery of the Elysian Box.  By talking to people and examining the environment, players discover puzzles, which when solved progress the story further.

As with the first game, puzzle can range from logic problems, to riddles, to simple calculation.  If stuck, players can spend 'Hint Coins' that they can find throughout the game - but there are a finite amount available, so they should only be used when needed.</desc>

A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins. Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other characters include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus. Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods Pga Tour 08</name>
		<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is the second game in the series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features touch swing controls where the player drags the stylus downwards to backswing and then back upwards again to shoot. A smooth motion leads to a more accurate shot, while the power of the shot is determined by  how long the backswing is and the speed of the motion. At the same time the accuracy of the shot is determined by the angle of the swing. By sliding the stylus right or left, the ball may draw or fade although too much will lead to a hook or a slice. Once the ball is in the air, a close-up image of it appears on the bottom screen. By sliding the stylus repeatedly across the ball, the player is able to make it rotate. 

A more traditional tap control is also available. With it the player swings by pressing a button to begin a backswing.

		<name>Master Of The Monster Lair</name>
		<desc>Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it.  There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.

The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens.  This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel.  After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.

The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom screen will show maps and item menus.  The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.

Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house.  There is also wireless capabilities where players can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.</desc>

It has sixteen massive bosses and over one hundred different types of enemies and you can change control styles, using the classic or using the left or right handed touch control.  There is also a Nanogauge that fills up when you destroy multiple enemies, earning you bonus multipliers.

You can play against a friend in duel mode or play in cooperative mode using multi-cards and can also upload your high scores online using the Wi-Fi connection.</desc>

Like in the other Rune Factory games, the gameplay is a mix of the farming found in the Harvest Moon series and battling. The player must grow and maintain crops and build up their home, and there are also dungeons to battle and befriend monsters in. The stamina of your character still depends on the meter of rune points, and once it is depleted it will start draining the meter of health points. 

New features this time around include dynamic schedules for NPCs, the ability for NPC villagers to accompany players into dungeons and multiplayer with the ability to play dungeons with up to two other players.</desc>

		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>On the island of Voya Nui, the evil Piraka have stolen the six elemental masks of the Toa. It's up to you to explore the island's temples, retrieve the masks, and defeat the Piraka and their minions.

Bionicle Heroes DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect gears and robot parts to solve simple puzzles by assembling LEGO-style ramps, bridges, and doorways.

The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.

The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in arenas laden with weapon and mask upgrades.</desc>

The game is set nine months after the events of the previous game, and the young sun god is summoned to battle a sinister force that has drained the landscape of colour, leaving it withered and faded where once it was luminous with life.

Ōkamiden shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, including the paintbrush used as a weapon against enemies and for puzzle solving. Chibiterasu can also team up with various companions during the game for additional abilities.</desc>

		<name>Electroplankton</name>
		<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec:  Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Trading Card Game</name>
		<desc>Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</desc>

		<desc>Ninjatown is a family-friendly tower defense game for the Nintendo DS that features the artwork and characters of ex-EGM editor Shawn Smith's "Shawnimals" universe. In the game, players must build Ninja Huts at key spots along a set pathway to defend each of the game's 36 levels from the invading forces of Mr. Demon. Players can build up to eight different kinds of Ninja Huts, each kind containing its own category of Ninja, from Wasabi pea-shooting Sniper Ninjas to bearded Mountain Ninjas. 

There are also a variety of "Ol' Master Ninja Powers" that can help the player in a pinch. These range from blowing into the DS microphone to push enemies backwards with a gust of wind to tapping enemies on screen in a short period of time in order to deal extra damage to them.

The game is divided into 9 "districts", each containing 3 standard tower defense maps and 1 boss map. Each level in the game takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, with the full game clocking in at around 6-8 hours.</desc>

		<path>./Tetris DS.zip</path>
		<name>Tetris Ds</name>
		<desc>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</desc>

		<desc>In Rune Factory 2 the player, Kyle by default, is an amnesiac who wanders into the town of Alvarna and is discovered by a girl named Mana. 

Like in the first Rune Factory game, the gameplay is a mix of the farming found in the Harvest Moon series and battling. The player must grow and maintain crops and build up their home, and there are also dungeons to battle and befriend monsters in. The stamina of your character still depends on the meter of rune points, and once it is depleted it will start draining the meter of health points. 

The player will marry a potential girl in the town and have child with her, the gender of the child will be of the player's choosing. Unlike the Harvest Moon games, the player will then continue playing as the child which is an integral part of the game's plot. At the point the goal of the game is to build a school, a goal left behind by Kyle one night when he left home.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons Game</name>
		<desc>When Bart finds a mysterious game manual, he realizes that he and his family have become the main characters of the newest hit video game -- The Simpsons Game!

Each of the Simpsons are playable in this sidescroller action game and feature their own wacky, special abilities. Homer can transform into a large blob and roll his way through levels. Bart can don a cowl and cape and become Bartman, using his slingshot and gliding ability to overcome the game's goons. Lisa can use an all-touchscreen Hand of Buddha to solve puzzles and remove obstacles from her path, and Marge can control mobs to overwhelm anyone who stands in her way.

Each of the game's twelve episodes parodies some bit of precious popular culture, including spoofs of such classic videogames as Frogger, Space Invaders, Pokémon, and Madden. The game is chock full of video and voice overs featuring the original cast and written by the show writers. The voices, story, and cutscenes means the game's irreverent humor include plenty of references for Simpsons fanatics who will catch all the inside jokes from old episodes.

Exclusive to the DS game is "Pet Homer," a sort of virtual pet game where the player collects various items to feed to Homer (and watch the crazy outcome), as well as several multiplayer minigames.</desc>

Letting you loose with hundreds of vehicles, each with distinctive performance abilities, you'll be racing your inch-long miniature motors on the wildest tracks where everyday household objects appear immense in size and can become lethal hazards.

The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

		<name>Draglade</name>
		<desc>Draglade is a unique take on fighting games.  Scientists have found a way to harness atmospheric energy called G-Cons, into a weapon called a glade, when hit against another object emits a sound.  Promoters realized the potential and soon developed a sport called Grapping, in which fighters use these glades not only to fight, but produce music as well in order to entertain fans.  You play as four different fighters, Hibito, Guy, Kyle, and Daichi, who's only goal is to become the top fighters in the sport of Grapping.

The gameplay is similar to Elite Beat Agents, you have to hit certain points on the screen at a certain time to create a rhythm in order to fight your opponent.  You can unlock other characters or customize your own, each with their own abilities and special moves.

You can also play against a friend using the Nintendo WFC multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Avalon Code</name>
		<desc>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.  

Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space.  Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus.  For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice.  Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves.  Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses.  Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</name>
		<desc>Professor Layton and his assistant Luke attend the unveiling of a new invention called a time machine.  The Prime Minister of London is volunteered as a test subject, but the machine explodes and there is no trace of him.  With the Prime Minister missing, London is in chaos!  Shortly after these events, the puzzle-solving pair receive a letter, which has apparently been sent by Luke's future self, stating that London is in serious trouble.  The Professor and Luke follow the directions in the letter, which leads them to their most exciting adventure yet...

Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is the third installment in the Professor Layton series. As with the previous games in the series, players explore game scenes by tapping on areas of interest with the stylus.  Doing so can cause Layton and Luke to examine objects, talk to characters, finding hint coins (which can be spent on hints for difficult puzzles) and most importantly, discover puzzles that can be solved.  Puzzles range from math, to logic, to riddles to sliding block puzzles, as well as many more different types.  There are also "secret" areas in scenes which, when tapped, may leave a puff of dust or a rustle of leaves.  Repeatedly tapping on these areas reveals a hidden secret, such as a bonus hint coin, or even a hidden, more difficult puzzle.

New to Unwound Future is the addition of the 'Super Hint'.  While as with the previous games, you can spend a hint coin to unlock up to three hints, there is also another option.  Once these three hints have been exhausted, for the price of two hint coins, you can unlock a more detailed 'Super Hint' as a last resort.  There are also three new minigames incorporated into the game.  In the Picture Book game, you must place the correct stickers in the right spots to make a story that makes sense.  In the Toy Car game, you must place tiles which navigate a toy car around the board, collect all the objects, and then reach the goal.  Finally, in the Parrot game, you must tie ropes onto pegs to help your parrot deliver parcels to people who have requested them.</desc>

Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the "Knight Chocolate," providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.</desc>

After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...

Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX.  Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same.  The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X.  However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.</desc>

		<name>Picross Ds</name>
		<desc>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1.  Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2.  Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3.  My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4.  Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</desc>

		<desc>Once, you were Suicide, the fastest rising star of the TNA iMPACT wrestling scene. You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</desc>

Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and powers!  Speed is the key!

		<desc>A pure adventure game for the Nintendo DS platform. You play as teen Ashley. Raised by her aunt Jessica, Ashley believed both of her parents were dead; on the eve of her 14th birthday, she receives a strange letter and a device called a DTS from her father.

Near the beginning of the game, you meet the ghost of a boy who can't remember his past. Over the course of the game, you will uncover the truth of both your own past and this mysterious boy's.

Much use is made of the unique features of the DS. You will use the stylus, the microphone, and even the "sleep" feature in addition to more traditional puzzle solutions. Your character cannot die; there are no action or arcade sequences.</desc>

		<desc>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements.  The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen.  Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</name>
		<desc>Ride into adventure with Link and Princess Zelda.

? Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

? Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

? Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

? Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he?s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

? When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

		<name>Planet Puzzle League</name>
		<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

Kage and Chihiro are ninjas from the Iga village, and are sworn by their loyalty to do all they can to rescue her. They must face Yoshiro's endless demon ninja army on their quest across Japan.

As ninjas, Kage and Chihiro make use of a variety of ninja equipment and abilities. Kage uses katana and shuriken, while Chihiro uses a kusarigama (a chain with a blade on the end). Between stages, the player can arrange orbs they've collected on a grid to create different ninjutsu, or ninja magic. These have a variety of uses, including elemental attacks, damage reduction, and quicker attacks. New skills are also regularly learned, such as combination moves and new attacks, as well as increased jump height (in keeping with the absurd jumps the original game is known for).

After clearing the game, a hard mode is unlocked. There is also an art gallery featuring production illustrations, unlocked by meeting various conditions in the game.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid Ds</name>
		<desc>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each levels.
As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)

The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.</desc>

		<name>Knights In The Nightmare</name>
		<desc>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.

Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.

Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.

The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.</desc>

It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her.

		<desc>After hearing about a strange inheritance dispute in the town of St. Mystere, Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke, travel there on behalf of Lady Dahlia, who has requested their presence to resolve the issue.  However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis.  As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen.  Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.  Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen.  Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles.  The selection of puzzles is quite varied.  If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'.  However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting.  While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes.  The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</desc>

		<name>Welcome to Animal Crossing - Wild World - Relay Station</name>
		<desc>Animal Crossing: Wild World is a 2005 social simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and is the second game in the Animal Crossing series.
Wild World focuses on living in a remote village populated with anthropomorphic animals, where the player is encouraged to perform any number of tasks, such as collecting and planting. Like all Animal Crossing titles, the game is synced to the console's clock and calendar, allowing the game to be played in real-time, which affects the occurrence of in-game events based on the current time of day or season. Wild World also utilizes Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which notably allows players to travel and visit the villages of other players via online play.</desc>

Players control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in the side-scrolling platform environment of Bowser's body, while also controlling the Koopa King himself in the top-down world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.</desc>

		<name>Simcity Ds</name>
		<desc>SimCity DS brings the classic series to the handheld consoles.

As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.

Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.

New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office.  Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities.  Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.</desc>

		<desc>Pinky Street: Kira Kira Music Hour is a music/rhythm game where you control a dancing girl by tapping your stylus to a series of beats in time to the music displayed on the touch screen.  Gamers play the game by holding the Nintendo DS as though it were a book, similar to Brain Age.

The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending on the difficulty level).  Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded "GOOD", "KIRA²" "RAINBOW", or "MISS" if you fail to hit it.

A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play.  They also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear.  There are also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.</desc>

		<name>Lunar Knights</name>
		<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

		<desc>In Tao's Adventure: Curse of the Demon Seal, the player controls the young Air Speller by the name of Tao. When his village gets attacked by Ancient Monsters, he is sent by the council over to the town of Mondominio to seek the help of a friend of his father. Mondominio is famous for containing the Monster Tower which was sealed for many years until a lightning storm hit the tower and broke the seal.

The game plays quite similarly to Azure Dreams. Most of it is based around leveling up, learning new spells, and collecting monster eggs from the monster tower, and then selling them in town or hatching them as pets that will aid you in your quest. The player begins with the basic elemental spells which are cast using the DS stylus. The battles, movements, and almost any action taken in the monster tower is turn-based. The higher the player progresses up the tower levels, the stronger the enemies become. With every five levels of the tower, the player will encounter a boss.</desc>

		<name>N+</name>
		<desc>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</desc>

		<name>Master of Illusion</name>
		<desc>Master of Illusion is different from other exercise games. This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training.

In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as  guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.

In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.

The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
		<desc>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>

		<name>Giana Sisters Ds</name>
		<desc>Giana Sisters DS is a modern 2009 remake of the cult game The Great Giana Sisters from the year 1987. The original game appeared on the C64 and Amiga, but had to be pulled from the shelves after Nintendo threatened to sue over similarities to the Super Mario games. Surprisingly, more than 20 years later the sisters make an appearance on the Nintendo DS.

Giana Sisters DS is a classic platformer. Giana is caught in a dream world and must now recover her lost diamonds and find a way to the mysterious castle. The game features more than 80 new levels (i.e. is not a one-to-one remake). There are also new special items that make use of the features of the DS. Giana can, for example, collect a bubble gum item that can be activated using the touch screen. The bubble enables Giana to fly and is controlled by blowing into the microphone. Another new feature is a world map that allows the player to select and replay levels.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Land Touch !</name>
		<desc>Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.

In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green. 

Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.

In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.</desc>

		<desc>Annie was just a simple girl who lived in a town located within the mainland. However, all she did was sleep and fantasize about becoming rich and famous someday by marrying up. Worried about their daughter, her parents consulted Annie's grandfather, a great alchemist, for advice on what to do. After a moment of thought, he decides to send her to Sera Island to take part in a large resort project in order to teach her to overcome her laziness. Thus, in the middle of the night, his homunculi steal Annie away to Sera Island; across land, across river, and across sea.
Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island is the first game to be released in North America to have the gameplay and structure of the "main" Atelier series, having less emphasis on RPG elements and more focus on item creation and resource management.</desc>

The player takes orders from various customers and then has to prepare the to fit their order and to satisfy their tastes. The way the meal is prepared is up to the player, and a number of different ingredients are available.

		<path>./Pokemon HeartGold Version.zip</path>
		<name>Pokémon HeartGold Version</name>
		<desc>Pokémon HeartGold is an enhanced remake of one of the second installments in the Pokémon Main RPG Series, Pokémon Gold.

Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pokémon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pokémon Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pokémon. While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pokémon. 

Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pokémon Yellow has been added. 

Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains "experience points" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as "watts", which is used to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.

The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.</desc>

This game is an action flight sim with a twist - it also has RPG elements. Each enemy plane you shoot down earns your experience points and gold, which unlocks better parts and planes for you to buy. Occasionally during flight you receive mayday calls from other planes under attack - if you are able to save them you can meet them back at the nearest airfield for a reward.

If the action is too much for you to handle, it has an autopilot mode which allows you to select targets and waypoints via the touchscreen. There is also a 4 player multicard mode where you can go head to head with friends.</desc>

The game is a collection of games based around a song, where the player must perform actions in time to the music to successfully complete the game.  All games are based around the simple motions of tapping, sliding and flicking the stylus.

As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of how the game you'll be playing works.  Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more.  After every four games, a special "remix" game appears, which combines the previous games into a hectic mix, where you never know what will be up next.</desc>

		<desc>The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper.  It is your job to restore order and "capture" all of the animals.

In this colorful and fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. 

There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P.  Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next.  Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up.  Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve.  Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit.  2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Legends</name>
		<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).  In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.  The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix.  Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards.  More than two player games require multiple game cards.</desc>

		<path>./World Ends with You, The.zip</path>
		<name>The World Ends With You</name>
		<desc>The World Ends With You is an action-RPG that puts players in the role of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen, loner of a teenager who wakes up to find himself in modern day Shibuya, Japan, with no memory of how he got there and a ticking clock in his hand that tells him to complete the mission... or face erasure.

Neku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as "Players" in a game that lasts seven days.  Each day, players are given various missions to perform by the "Reapers" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.

Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against "The Noise", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone.  Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.  

Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.

There is also a wi-fi mini-game called "Ten Pin Slammer", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.</desc>

		<desc>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star 0</name>
		<desc>Phantasy Star Zero takes place on an alternate Earth 200 years after the Great Blank, a massive war that has reduced the once-prosperous civilization to almost nothing. The sole surviving Humans have worked hard to exist peacefully and have built thriving Cities. The Humans that adventure past the outskirts of these Cities, called Hunters, explore the vast wilderness and hunt dangerous monsters to keep Cities safe. Players will take up the role of Hunters and select from three types of races and different classes, as well as gender for a total of 14 customizable character types. Each character type will play very differently and give players access to a great range of items, armor and weapons. Featuring over 350 unique weapons, gamers will venture out on Earth, combat dangerous monsters to gain experience and meet new major characters. As players explore further, they will unravel the mystery of the Great Blank and discover a dangerous new force that must be stopped.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders Extreme</name>
		<desc>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

		<desc>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game. 

The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the witches. 

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles. Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</desc>

Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.</desc>

		<name>Super Dodgeball Brawlers</name>
		<desc>Super Dodgeball Brawlers is a remake of the classic dodgeball sports NES title with characters that resembles those from River City Ransom and Double Dragon.

The original mode still exists, but now has new rules that allow punching, kicking and using weapons against the opposing team.  There is a create-a-character option as well.

There are also over a hundred special attacks that can be used against opponents such as Cactus Attack, Panda Shot and Spear to name a few. The new Super Gauge System, when filled, can be given to a player on the court to boosts stats or unleash an "Instant Kill" against an opponent.

Friends can go head-to-head against a friend or even join up against eight people using Wi-Fi.</desc>

		<name>Puyo Pop Fever</name>
		<desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

		<desc>Playing with balls is fun! Magnetica is a fiendish action puzzler game from Japanese developer Mitchell Corporation, and the sequel to the 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

		<name>Henry Hatsworth In The Puzzling Adventure</name>
		<desc>Poppycock!  When the number one pompous adventurer, Henry Hatsworth, discovers a golden hat deep in the jungle, it makes him twenty years younger - but it also unleashes another world, releasing hordes of nasty monsters!  To top it off, the number two pompous adventurer, Weaselby, is one step ahead of Hatsworth - eager to snag up the remaining pieces of the Golden Suit and claim the number one position in the Pompous Adventurer's Club for himself!  Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?  Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!

Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword.  When he does, they fall down into the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack.  Players must match the block enemies up with other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once again.

Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up.  If he fills it up enough, it's Tea Time!  This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.</desc>

		<name>Electroplankton</name>
		<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec:  Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>

		<path>./Ultimate Spider-Man.zip</path>
		<name>Ultimate Spider-man</name>
		<desc>For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style  of their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.

Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.

The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals vary between the two.

Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick, shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen. His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.

A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched and red ones avoided.

In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction. 
Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly, so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.

The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.

A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one fights.</desc>

Like in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi is carrying Baby Mario on his back and is walking through the countryside. There are enemies, pits in the ground, and other obstacles you must circumnavigate. You do not control Yoshi; you must use the stylus to draw alternate paths (made of small clouds), kill enemies, and throw eggs for him. There is only one level, but it can be played as a Marathon game, Time Attack, Score Attack, and a couple other modes. You can also play against a friend in Versus mode.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Platinum Version</name>
		<desc>Together with Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, this game is the 3rd games in the 4th generation of the Pokémon series. Set in a new region, Sinnoh, it includes 107 new Pokémon, bringing the total up to 493. Pokémon Platinum includes for the first time in the 4th generation, the Battle Frontier which can be played on and off-line, make Poffins on-line. Players can collect badges, challenge the Elite Four, and become the ultimate Pokémon master.

The game continues the basic idea of previous Pokémon games - the player, a new trainer, sets out on a quest to catch every known Pokémon and defeat the Pokémon league. Along the way, the player will attempt to foil the plots of the evil organization, Team Galactic, who seek to use a trio of legendary Pokémon to awaken a sleeping titan with the power to control space. There are many sidequests and other activities along the way, the Battle Frontier, expanded on-line options, downloadable content via Mystery Gift, a brand new GTS with the option to receive notifications of completed traded over the Wii, record battle videos, the option to submit one's Pokémon party data for others to see and the Distortion World, which defies the laws of gravity and contains Platinum's mascot, Giratina.

The core Pokémon series features an RPG turn-based battle system. Each monster can learn up to four attacks. In a single turn, the two opponents select their attacks, and the one with the higher Speed attacks first. The amount of damage is influenced by the Attack and Defense stats. In the past, attacks were automatically classified as Physical or Special based on their elemental type. In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum each attack can be individually categorized, so attacks which use natural elements are Special, and those which use simple force are Physical.

The Pokémon Contests from Ruby and Sapphire return, with many new features. In addition to the attack performance, where the player must try to impress the judge with flashy moves, players will also dress up their Pokémon and dance in time to music. Diamond and Pearl also bring back the real time system from Gold and Silver, where day and night are reflected in your game. Some Pokémon are only catchable during certain times.</desc>

		<name>Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie Bbq</name>
		<desc>Fairy Tale Land faces its greatest crisis yet! A plague has swept through the population, turning former upstanding citizens into blood-crazed zombies.

Fortunately, the world's greatest adventurer and weapons collector, Little Red 'Ready To Rock' Riding Hood is still unaffected and is determined to uncover the source of the disease. She teams up with Momotaro, the boy who emerged from a peach in the Japanese folk tale, and the two set out on their quest. Red has her trusty machine gun and Momotaro has his ninja stars. They'll take down anything, living or dead, that gets in their way.

Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is a classic, arcade-style vertical shooter for one player. The action is viewed from a high angle, with visuals taking up both screens of the DS. The game world is presented in 3D, as are bosses and various other enemies. However, the main character and standard zombies are 2D sprites.

The player's character (either Red or Momotaro, neither of whom has any obvious advantage over the other) is situated at the bottom of the lower screen and waves of zombies march toward her/him. The character automatically moves forward through the world, but the player can control left/right movement along a 2D plane, enabling them to move out of the way of obstacles, projectiles and zombies.
Touching the stylus to any point on the screen causes the character to shoot in that direction, and shots can be fired along the entire length of the play area (i.e. to targets at the top of the DS's upper screen).
The standard machine gun has infinite ammo, but must be reloaded, which simply means taking the stylus off the screen for a second. Along the way, there are other weapons to pick up - a shotgun, laser rifle and flamethrower (hence the 'BBQ' of the title). These special weapons have limited ammo, so must be conserved.
Players also start with a grenade launcher, which can be launched by double-tapping an area on the screen. Ammo is strictly limited, but can be replenished.

There are 21 levels, split over seven chapters. Each chapter is set in a different location based on a fairy tale or classic story and consists of two regular levels (fighting through hordes of zombies, as well as some mini-bosses) followed by a boss fight.

The boss fights are one of the game's main selling points, with varied and lengthy encounters against twisted, undead versions of Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Santa Claus and others.

By completing the game on higher difficulty levels, new gameplay modes can be unlocked, including Boss Attack (defeat every boss in sequence) and Survival (timed battle against waves of zombies).</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts II and follows the story of Jiminy Cricket, King Mickey, Donald Duck and Goofy in Disney Castle. While organizing the records in Jiminy's journal from his travels with Sora and his friends, Jiminy Cricket's curiosity about the line "Thank Naminé" results in him finding a message that he did not write: "Their hurting will be mended when you return to end it." To investigate this message, King Mickey digitizes the contents of the journal and goes into the simulated world to investigate; awakening a virtual Data-Sora on the virtual Destiny Islands to carry out the contents of the journal to uncover the identity of those who are "hurting".</desc>

		<name>Custom Robo Arena</name>
		<desc>The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in North America.

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

		<desc>The city of Egvard, capital of Bretwalde, has been overrun during the funeral for the late king. Prince Serdic is killed in the resulting battle, but not before he gives his legendary sword to his body double. Now, "Prince Serdic" and his followers must retake the kingdom.

The battles in Rondo of Swords use the unusual Route Maneuver System. Instead of walking up to an enemy and attacking, instead you will run through enemies to attack. This adds tactical considerations; you can easily attack multiple enemies in a turn, you can run through allies to get bonuses to your attack, and you can attack from the sides or behind to get an advantage.</desc>

		<name>Heroes Of Mana</name>
		<desc>Heroes of Mana is a continuation of Square Enix's, World of Mana series, but with a new twist in the gameplay.  This time around the gameplay is now real-time, where players can build bases and their own armies consisting of humans, monsters and rabites throughout the Mana series.

The story takes place when a witch by the name of Anise brought darkness to the land, unleashing hordes of monsters on the world.  She is eventually defeated by the guardians of the trees, but the evil she unleashed was unable to me stopped until the Mana Goddess uses the Mana Sword to seal off the darkness in eight stones, bringing peace to the world.  This is where the players takes control of the main protagonist, Roget, a younger warrior who has learned that somehow the evil is coming back into the world and must embark on a quest with 10 other comrades and countless created units and stop the evil forces from being unleashed again.

The player uses the stylus mostly throughout the game, touching on a certain character and touching somewhere on the screen to move them around or draw circles around multi characters to move them all at once.  Players do battle by selecting their unit and tapping enemy units with the stylus to use that units attack skill on that selected enemy.  Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game, Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base, a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource gathering.

Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players.  Players can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough.  The music is also composed by Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario RPG as well.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest Monsters - Joker 2</name>
		<desc>Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 gameplay follows closely to its predecessor. Players explore areas and tame wild monsters into their party. Monsters fight in turn-based combat and grow stronger. The battle system itself is very similar to previous Dragon Quest Monsters games. The player controls up to three monsters that make up the party, and can issue them direct orders or set them to one of 4 AI settings. This game features two new monster sizes: large monsters, which use up two spaces on one of the player's two benches, and gargantuan monsters, who take up an entire bench on their own. The main character, who is henceforth referred to as the Hero, does not directly participate in battles except for when the player uses items. He can, however, use any item in his possession and not just the ones 'in hand'. 311 monsters from the Dragon Quest games appear in Joker 2, with a few new species, many from the original "Dragon Warrior Monsters" games. This is the second game in the series to feature Wi-Fi support, after the first Joker game, and the first to support direct battling between players.
Square Enix released Joker 2 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on March 31, 2011. Professional features over 100 new monsters, as well as new regions and abilities, but the same story. Players are able to import their old monsters from the original game.</desc>

		<name>Sega Superstars Tennis</name>
		<desc>Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.

Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.

Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.

Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. 

Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</desc>

		<path>./Lock's Quest.zip</path>
		<name>Lock's Quest</name>
		<desc>Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi. Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their leader Lord Agony.

The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses through the entire game.

Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's going on in another area.

Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent will face.</desc>

		<desc>Transformers: Autobots is the first game of the double movie tie-in for the 2008 movie. In the Autobots version players take command of the good guys. The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Decepticons, and learn the basics of the mission on earth. 

From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes.

Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Transformers: Decepticons, in several game modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the Autobots side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared.

Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Aubots version is quite different from the Decepticons version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.</desc>

		<desc>Picross 3D is a pseudo-sequel to Picross DS.  As with the original game, your goal is to uncover the hidden image by using the number clues as your guide.  But unlike Picross DS, where the puzzles were flat, in Picross 3D, each puzzle is encased in a cube of a varying size and shape.  By chipping away and rotating the cube, the player can reveal the hidden picture.

Picross 3D has approximately 350 puzzles, across a variety of different themes.  Each puzzle is grouped into a particular theme, such as "Beach", "Sports" or "Fire", and when all the puzzles are found for a theme, a medal is added to the theme to indicate that it is complete.  Nearly every puzzle has a possibility for a three star rating.  To earn all three stars, the player must:

 solve the puzzle
 complete the puzzle within the time limit
 not make any mistakes

As with Picross DS, Picross 3D features a puzzle creator.  The user can create their own puzzles, and then, using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, send them onto the Internet to trade with friends, as well as receive additional ones.</desc>

		<desc>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is struck by lightning!  They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush.  Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible.  By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices.  At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them.  Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels.  However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</desc>

		<path>./Polarium.zip</path>
		<name>Polarium</name>
		<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>

		<path>./Scribblenauts.zip</path>
		<name>Scribblenauts</name>
		<desc>Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to offer suggestions.

This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star is provided.

By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels. The existing levels can also be edited and the way certain summoned objects interact with each other can also be modified.</desc>

The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.

The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time. 

Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to twice as many in previous titles.

The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.</desc>

		<desc>Arino wants to be the greatest gamer in the world, but he's continually defeated by his friends at every new game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his game challenges.

Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free play mode once all challenges have been cleared.</desc>

Your character's vehicle may be a little cart, trike, or box, for example. Weapons include rockets, Salty Balls, Cheesy Poofs, the beloved Cow and even an Anal probe.

		<name>Disney's 102 Dalmatians : Puppies to the Rescue</name>
		<desc>The game itself follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</desc>

		<name>4 Wheel Thunder</name>
		<desc>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.

The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the "boost" power-ups that lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</desc>

		<name>4x4 Evo</name>
		<desc>4x4 Evolution is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's.  Actual trucks from manufacturers such as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota and more are included. 

The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks.

One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option.  The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.

In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode.  The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</desc>

		<name>Bang! Gunship Elite</name>
		<desc>Welcome to the Gunship Elite. Sorry to rush you out of training school, but we have full confidence in your abilities. You are fighting for the future of our cultures and the heritage of your Arikhan warrior ancestry. The Alliance is being invaded by the Sektar and their bloodthirsty allies, the Morgoths. While for years we have held them, their numbers are wearing us down. We must take the offensive soon. That is where you come in...

Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down. Add spectacular graphics, lots of "power-ups" (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships), and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your typical "fight against all odds" story.</desc>

Gameplay progresses through five "worlds":  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A "classic" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new "3D" isometric perspective.</desc>

		<name>Atari Anniversary Edition</name>
		<desc>Atari Anniversary Edition features 12 classic Atari games. The Dreamcast / Windows version contains the following games:
-Asteroids
-Asteroids Deluxe
-Battlezone
-Centipede
-Crystal castles
-Gravitar
-Millipede
-Missile Command
-Pong
-Super Breakout
-Tempest
-Warlords
In addition to the pure emulation mode, there is an option that allows to display the original terminal around the game screen, which reinforces the impression of playing on an arcade machine. Each game allows you to activate a graphics improvement mode (variable depending on the game), for example "improved" Asteroids simply offers a static background, or "improved" Warlords offers a complete graphic overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the improved version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a Tempest mod designed in 1982 by Duncan Brown.
Also included is a gallery of game images, a video interview with Nolan Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.</desc>

		<name>Carrier</name>
		<desc>Carrier is the first survival horror game released for the Dreamcast.  As the game starts you are Jack Ingles, a member of a special forces team.  You are sent in by Helicopter to investigate a carrier that has not been responding to radio contact after completing a mission. As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down.  After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive.

The game is played from a third person perspective.  You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way.  The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades.  After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates.  While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</desc>

Gameplay is like a regular real-time strategy game, with the player acting in the role of commander without taking a direct hand in anything. Give the agents orders and try to keep an eye on all of them as they carry them out. Each agent's skills can be upgraded after missions. Keep them out of sight of guards, spring traps on them, or engage them in hand-to-hand or ranged combat.</desc>

		<desc>The agreement between the Earth Council and the Haak Delegates came about, not through political or military means, but by financial measures.  Three years after their mother-ship first orbited the earth the Haak were invited to the surface in peace and in the search for mutual rewards.

This agreement has been upheld for 7 years with only the occasional backlash causing small localised human/Haak conflict but the Haak have kept up their end of the bargain - until now.

We have started to lose contact with the human installations around the Haak settlements.  The first three recon forces sent to investigate the disturbances were shot out of the air.  The Red Dog Tactical Response Team is now preparing for war.

As commander of the Red Dog assault vehicle, your job is to rid our people of the now aggressive Haak forces currently occupying the continents of planet earth.  Good Luck - Don't dent the tank!</desc>

		<name>Sega Marine Fishing</name>
		<desc>The sequel to the arcade and Dreamcast title SEGA Bass Fishing, this game features deep-sea fishing where you can catch must more than just bass. The game offers 15 types of fish, 5 different locales, and 16 types of lures with many more unlockable. By catching fish, you earn item cards with equipment, boats, accessories, fish and artifacts for an aquarium.

There is also a network feature where you can log on to SEGA's Marine Fishing webpage to compete in fishing competitions. Play in arcade mode, free fishing mode or the more involved original mode (which features several mini-games), and view your rewards in aquarium mode. The original mode was not included in the arcade version, and the mini-games train different techniques (luring, casting, fighting...)</desc>

		<desc>Plasma Sword - Nightmare of Bilstein is the successor of Star Gladiator released for Playstation. Like it's predecessor it was first released on Arcade before ported to the Dreamcast.

The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called "plasma moves", visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough "plasma power". Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.</desc>

		<desc>In this game the player takes the role of an ancient warrior who has been brought to life by the benevolent wizard Wart. It seems that the evil goddess Kardis is about to be resurrected by her faithful servants. The only way to stop them is to gather famous heroes from Lodoss War universe and to defeat the evil ones in a battle.

Record of Lodoss War is quite similar to  Diablo gameplay-wise. It is an action RPG which is heavily combat-oriented. You can directly control only the main hero, while the legendary heroes who join him on the quest are controlled by the AI. As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to froge weapons and to imbue them with runes. As your adventures into the surrounding land go on, you can return to your HQ, the Goblin Fortress, and get much needed healing and healing potions (free of charge).</desc>

Released in 1999 as one of the console's launch titles, the game was one of the first mission-based racing games. The gameplay involves the player challenging other drivers on the Shuto Expressway in order to gain money to modify and enhance his or her car. The game features a wide variety of Japanese cars and tuning parts to purchase as the player progresses through rivals.

When released in Japan, ShutokÅ Battle was one of the best selling Dreamcast titles at this time. The game is based on illegal highway racing in Tokyo's Wangan highway with custom tuned cars. A such phenomenon is growing popular in Japan since the 90's with its dedicated manga (ShutokÅ Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle).</desc>

		<desc>Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.
The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.
There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</desc>

		<desc>As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage. 

This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.</desc>

As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.</desc>

While there is peace between the races, there is no sense of unity. This all changes when, without warning, a bio-mechanical Armada wages war on the whole of humanity. Now as a starship captain representing one of the six main races of humanity, your charge is to take the fight to the Armada and save humanity.

Gameplay consists of commanding a starship as you explore the universe, taking out Armada opposition where you see it. Along the way you can take missions and answer calls for help which will provide you with valuable experience and credits to upgrade your ship. In this way, you can build your strength until you are ready to take on the Armada full force in an attempt to end the threat once and for all.</desc>

CPU has two different modes: Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple "how many games can I win in a row" against the computer. Finally, if you complete the Challenge mode (where you must complete certain puzzels as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.) the Edit mode will become available. In here you can put together your own puzzles for you or your friends to complete.</desc>

In this game, you control Buzz through 14 missions on eight different planets. In each mission, your goal is to race to the end of the level before the bad guy does. If you do so successfully, you face off against the villian, and hopefully capture them. In addition to capturing the villain, there are secondary objectives like collecting robot parts and getting the fastest time through the level.</desc>

		<name>Caesars Palace 2000 : Millennium Gold Edition</name>
		<desc>Caesars Palace 2000 is a gambling simulation video game developed by Runecraft and published by Interplay Entertainment. It was released in North America and Europe in June 2000 for the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows' PCs. It is named after the famous Caesars Palace luxury hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Interplay announced in late 1999 that they were working on a title for the Dreamcast which was known to be a 3D simulation of gambling with traditional casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game machines. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds and payouts verified by a Ph.D in statistics. The PC version of the game received praise for its graphics and sound, but the Dreamcast version received criticism for its presentation, graphics, and slow pace.</desc>

The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.
After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.
There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.</desc>

		<name>Floigan Bros. : Episode 1</name>
		<desc>Hoigle and Moigle Floigan are brothers who live in a junkyard. Hoigle is the elder of the two. He's also the smaller of the two, and by far the smarter. In this game you control Hoigle as he helps his large but slow-witted younger brother Moigle to build a secret invention. Floigan Bros. is an adventure game with a strong emphasis on cooperation. Hoigle must work with Moigle to accomplish many tasks. Moigle, on the other hand, is more frequently interested in playing games or eating. By playing with Moigle, Hoigle can eventually teach him the skills he needs to get the job done. Floigan Bros. featured some online content that was downloadable using the Dreamcast's built-in modem.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in the Takumi/Capcom arcade shooter trilogy, Giga Wing 2 was originally designed for the Naomi arcade system and later ported to the Dreamcast. It is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up featuring four-player simultaneous action, high-res 3D graphics, and an orchestral score. There are four characters to choose from, each with his own storyline and fighter/spaceship. Each ship has its own weapon type and speed. Like the previous Giga Wing and Mars Matrix games, gameplay is designed around bullet absorption/reflection mechanics, large numbers of enemies, and giant boss fights. Giga Wing 2 adds the ability to choose from two different bullet reflection powers: reflect force and reflect laser. The reflect force repulses enemy shots, while the reflect laser uses them to charge up a beam weapon.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Heavy Metal world created by Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley, this fighting title allows you to take control of a team of three fighters, ranging from a basic all-rounder, or a lightning fast female to a huge bulky mass of power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles.

The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace.
The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.</desc>

		<desc>Iron Aces is fictional World War 2 flight simulator. What that "fictional" means is that great liberties have been taken with the historical accuracy of the world and events. The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.

The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Japanese manga/anime of the same name, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a 2D fighter from Capcom. Take on the role of one of 18 characters and battle your friends in Arcade Mode, or take on the role of Jotaro "JoJo" Kujo and his friends in Super Story Mode as they battle their way to the evil vampire, Dio Brando, in order to save the world!

A Dreamcast version also exists, but without the Super Story Mode and a couple of missing characters. Both games were ports of Capcom's arcade fighter, JoJo's Venture and its update, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.</desc>

		<name>KAO the Kangaroo</name>
		<desc>A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.

Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</desc>

There are now up to 56 characters to use (most you have to unlock), including new characters like Jill Valentine from Resident Evil and Tron Bonne from Mega Man Legends.
Another new gameplay feature allows your team mates to come in during battle and give you a little health boost. This helps in lasting the distance in Survival mode, but they can also be hit by on coming attacks from the enemy.</desc>

		<name>NBA Hoopz</name>
		<desc>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.

NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</desc>

		<desc>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</desc>

Outtrigger is a combat game that features both first- and third-person perspectives, and while it comes with a batch of single-player scenario missions, the game favors multiplayer mayhem. A split-screen mode for up to four players allows friends to compete in-house, and online cooperative play lets you form teams over the Internet. Settings include castle ruins, an observatory, abandoned train stations, and more. The game's cache of weapons includes flamethrowers, photon torpedoes, and rocket launchers, to name a few.</desc>

		<name>The Typing of the Dead</name>
		<desc>This is essentially the same game as the arcade light-gun rail-shooter House of the Dead 2, except they've turned it into a edu-tainment typing trainer. Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries.

Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).</desc>

		<name>Vanishing Point</name>
		<desc>Vanishing Point is an arcade style racer featuring real cars and road course style tracks.  The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock.  Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.

The standard racing game modes are here:  Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race.  One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition.  You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events.  Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.

The selection of cars is quite diverse.  You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.</desc>

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after the ball is hit.  The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after the ball is fielded!  For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon its release.  This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.</desc>

The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.</desc>

		<desc>Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters. In contrast to most games of this type, there is a story. A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot's sky fortress, you must rescue your friends. You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control. Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</desc>

The “Project K” Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as “Eden,” holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and you’re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos.

You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.</desc>

		<name>Samba de Amigo</name>
		<desc>Samba De Amigo is a highly unique game:  a maracas simulation.  Game play is based around a special maracas controller that you use to interact with the music.  The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in.  It also senses when the player shakes the maracas.  As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress.  A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.

The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources.  Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like "Macarena" and "Tequila."</desc>

		<desc>A terrorist organization has stolen nuclear weapons from a facility in Russia, intending to sell them to various third-world nations, initiating a global conflict. The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as "The Shop". The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world!

Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp.

		<name>Sonic Shuffle</name>
		<desc>Much like Mario Party and Crash Bash, Sonic Shuffle has Sonic and his team playing a board game style tournament, where mini-games are at every turn. 

Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.

Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event.

The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).</desc>

		<desc>Pick the warrior, thief, or wizard, and fight through five huge levels, each with  its own boss. Your main weapons are your fists, but you can pull out weapons for quick kills. You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though.

Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.

Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.</desc>

		<name>Soulcalibur</name>
		<desc>A fighting game to end all fighting games.  A sequel to Soul Blade, Soul Calibur takes place in a time inspired by a mixture of 16th-century ancient China and oriental medieval fantasies and legends.  

All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character.  In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed "un-blockable" and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker. 

In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode.  There is also a "museum" where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.</desc>

		<desc>A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing.

Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day's gaming titles.</desc>

		<desc>In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken over Pao Pao Park.  The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.

The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.</desc>

		<desc>Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast.  As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.

There are several game modes to choose from.  First up is the Championship.  In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins.  The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to the original game which was released two years prior. The games graphics have been improved, and there is a greater roster of players to choose from. The most noteworthy addition is that of female players, such as Monica Seles and Venus and Serena Williams. You cannot however play as a male against a female.
The gameplay is a lot faster than the original. The players you control move a lot faster, as do the AI computer players. Less diving, but more getting at shots that go behind you and over the shoulder shots.

The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player. Build you player up, buy equipment and hire pros to play in doubles matches with you.</desc>

Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

		<desc>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, released as Tony Hawk's Skateboarding in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe, is a skateboarding video game developed by Neversoft. Published by Activision in 1999, it is the first entry in the Tony Hawk's series of video games. Development began after Tony Hawk's debut stint at the 1998 X-Games.

Pro Skater was originally released for the PlayStation on August 31, 1999, and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and N-Gage. It also received a Game Boy Color adaptation, and was released for Xbox in 2001 as part of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x collection. The game was met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its innovative gameplay, level designs and control scheme. It was also commercially successful, selling rapidly upon its opening month. The game resulted in a successful franchise that has continued to be active, with the tenth installment and latest release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 released in October 2015.</desc>

		<desc>More drivin' &amp; blastin' fun in this sequel to Vigilante 8. The Coyotes gang returns with a shocking new leader to seek revenge on OMAR, and the Vigilantes gang. 

New cars, weapons and landscapes add new excitement to the game. There are 18 charcters with storylines to walk through, which in turn affects the other characters in the game, and how well you do in the single player missions will determine what happens in the later levels.

The Dreamcast and N64 versions both have 4 player modes, while the PSX sticks with 2 player gaming.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Athlete 2K was SEGA's contribution to the list of track &amp; field based games released to tie-in with the Sydney 2000 summer Olympic games. The game itself is presented as a 3D sports simulation where the ability to repeatedly mash your pad buttons is essential if you want to take home the gold. 
The game features seven events in which you must demonstrate that you are the best. The 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 110-meter hurdles, javelin throw, and 1500-meter run are all that stand between you and gold medal glory.

There is a choice of 10 athletes to compete with however a character editor is available to personalise the name, face and clothing of your chosen competitor. 
Virtua Athlete 2K also supports simultaneous four-player participation and a now defunct on-line internet leader board.</desc>

For those that do not know, the Virtua Fighter series is your classic beat-em-up, with a bunch of characters all trying to kick, punch, throw and body slam the bejesus out of each other. Each of the characters has over a hundred possible moves and the game plays very faithfully to the original. The game features interesting arena to fight in which are more like real locations in they are not flat and some parts can be broken away during the match.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to the original game which was released two years prior. The games graphics have been improved, and there is a greater roster of players to choose from. The most noteworthy addition is that of female players, such as Monica Seles and Venus and Serena Williams. You cannot however play as a male against a female.
The gameplay is a lot faster than the original. The players you control move a lot faster, as do the AI computer players. Less diving, but more getting at shots that go behind you and over the shoulder shots.

The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player. Build you player up, buy equipment and hire pros to play in doubles matches with you.</desc>

		<path>./Worms Armageddon v1.001 (1999)(MicroProse)(US)[!].gdi</path>
		<name>Worms Armageddon</name>
		<desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. 

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</desc>

You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</desc>

		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic is a Sailor Moon themed competitive puzzle game. Players first select a character from among five Sailor Scouts and Chibiusa, each with a unique special move. They will then challenge each other in competition. Each player has a board which contains some balloons, in either red, yellow, green or blue. These balloons can be shot at in order to gain points and fill up the power bar. Balloons of the same color that are adjacent to one another with all be destroyed and generate more points. The goal is to avoid being the player whose balloons are pushed downwards off the board, and to make the opponent receive this fate. As groups of balloons are destroyed, they can reveal power-ups as well as produce black balloons on the opponent's board. Black balloons can only be destroyed by groups of colored balloons being removed adjacent to them. Players with a filled power bar can unleash special abilities.</desc>

Despite the fact that Carranger was adapted into Power Rangers: Turbo, the game was never brought to the North American market as such because, by the time Turbo premiered in 1997, the Nintendo 64 had been on North American shores for several months. The N64 had only just come out in Japan when the game was released, so not everyone had switched yet.</desc>

		<desc>SD Ultra Battle: Seven Densetsu ("SD Ultra Battle: Seven Legend") is a fighter game for the Super Famicom that features super deformed characters from the Ultra Seven series, itself a follow-up to the original Ultraman tokusatsu show.

Along with series protagonist Ultraseven, the game also features major kaiju villains Eleking and King Joe as playable characters.

The game was a companion product to SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu, and was released the same day. Both carts employ Bandai's officially licensed Nintendo peripheral the Sufami Turbo to link together to share game data, allowing characters from one game to appear and fight characters in the other. Because Seven Densetsu was released in the miniature Sufami Turbo cartridge format, it cannot be played without that peripheral.</desc>

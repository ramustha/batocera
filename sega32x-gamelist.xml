		<name>NBA Jam : Tournament Edition</name>
		<desc>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic slam dunks. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four players can take play with AI for missing players. 2v2 and 2v1 are supported.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Players can now be injured requiring them to be subbed out to let them recover. 

Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, Tournament Edition also includes "Hot Spots", "Powerups", "Juice Mode" and "Tournament Mode".

Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>After Burner</name>
		<desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</desc>

Dr. Robotnik, as usual, has an evil plan for the park. He wants the power emerald which supplies electricity to the entire island. What's worse, he has imprisoned several of Knuckles' friends in the "combi confiner." This contraption only allows Knuckles to free one of his friends at a time by using a ring force bond. 

New characters featured include Vector the Crocodile, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee. There also two characters whose sole purpose is to slow you down, Heavy the Robot, and Bomb. Chaotix adds several new power-ups and 3D bonus levels as well.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Carnage is a one-on-one fighting game set in outer space.  The story begins as a prison barge is hijacked by it's cargo in an escape attempt.  The resulting chaos caused the barge to crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused extensive damage to both ships.  There were only 8 survivors, 4 from each ship.  What's worse, there's only one escape pod.  You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life.

The gameplay in Cosmic carnage is similar to Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace.  Some of the fighters can be customized with different armor combinations, allowing them access to different special moves.</desc>

		<name>Darxide</name>
		<desc>One of the last 32X games released (and exclusively in Europe), DarXide is a 3-D space shooter, inspired in part by the arcade gameplay of Asteroids. It is one of the few 32X games to used texture-mapped polygons. 

Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy oncoming asteroids and alien vessels before they annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. Asteroids break apart into smaller rocks, which much also be hunted down and destroyed. Aliens likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels.

Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and then vaporized will sometimes drop shield or energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser blasts or collisions. New weapons can also be found. Players have a time limit to meet all objectives in a stage before they are forced to land and try again. The right side of the HUD shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate size), while the left shows the player's distance to their base (and so, time remaining in the stage).</desc>

		<name>Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000</name>
		<desc>This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is somewhat like Sega arcade classic Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment.  The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.

Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element.  Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit.  To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups.  In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems.  This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.</desc>

Many of the same features from other baseball games are present and has three different game modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff, and home run derby, but what makes this version different from the others is a lack of MLB license, though it does feature a MLBPA license with top players of the time such as Roger Clemens, Otis Nixon, Bobby Larkin among many others.

Though it doesn't have a full MLB license, it tries to recreate the MLB experience by omitted the teams nicknames but using similar team colors and using the actual stadiums and redoing them without the distinctive trademarks.  It doesn't feature a battery back-up, but does have a password feature for a player to pick up and play later if they choose.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</desc>

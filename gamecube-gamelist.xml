		<path>./Alien Hominid (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Alien Hominid</name>
		<desc>You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.

The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</desc>

		<name>Batman Begins</name>
		<desc>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.

Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.

Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.

You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil is an action-adventure game with diverse game play. Most of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.</desc>

		<desc>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.

Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</desc>

		<name>Blowout</name>
		<desc>Blowout is a game that takes a classic gameplay concept and updates it with modern graphics and sounds. This game is a side-scrolling platform shooter. The graphics are 3-dimensional polygons, but the action stays almost entirely in a 2-dimensional plane.

The setting for the game is a space station that has been overrun by hostile aliens. You play as a bad-ass soldier dude who will single-handedly wipe the aliens out.

You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.  You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman returns with a new cel-shaded 3D look. The same storyline applies, however. Bomberman has been given the task of taking back a powerful element of magic, and protecting it from the hands of evil. To do so, he must use his bombing abilites to blast his way through mazes filled with crazy enemies and hidden secrets. There are 5 worlds in all, each with 16 levels to complete.

		<desc>Bomberman is back in his second game for the Nintendo Gamecube. Jetters features a single-player campaign and the fan-favorite multiplayer battles. In the single-player game, players take on the roles of Bomberman and Max. Your goal is to stop the Hige Hige Bandits who plan to destroy Planet Bomber by crashing an artificial comet, Dark Star, into it. In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure.

Jetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature which keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action.

There are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.</desc>

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter."  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</desc>

The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. 

The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</desc>

		<desc>Developed by High Voltage Software and licensed by Warner Bros., Charlie and the Chocolate Factory puts players right into the world of the film. You'll find the factory rampaged by the other children, who are running amok with greed and impishness. Use your special candy powers and the assistance of the Oompa-Loompas to restore order to Willy Wonka's sugary establishment. Beyond this, Charlie will have to use a variety of candy to overcome obstacles and potential enemies. Everlasting Gobstoppers, for instance, are basically rocks that Charlie can throw around.

		<name>Chibi-Robo!</name>
		<desc>Gamers take control of the Chibi Robo, a pint-sized machine designed specifically to take care of a family's house. The robot needs to keep the house "happy." To do that, Chibi must walk around the home and clean it up, interact with other machines and people, and even -- according to the storyline - stop a group of bumbling thieves from making off with precious valuables. An electricity counter located in the bottom-right corner of the screen constantly counts down. When Chibi is getting low, players will want to recharge. The game features a day and night system, where days last about 10 minutes and nights the same. The environments slightly change depending on the time of day. For instance, a character not available in the day might be sleeping on the couch at night, and robots normally roaming the level in the afternoon might be gone in the evening.</desc>

		<path>./Crazy Taxi (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Crazy Taxi</name>
		<desc>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. 

In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.

Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</desc>

		<desc>Cubivore is a "Call of the Wild" brought to an interactive media. Gento Matsumotos serene and surreal portrait of wilderness lost then civilization reverting (or progressing) to wilderness. The music though not long is of high quality and presents eerie and beautiful pieces. 
Of course the most obvious thing about Cubivore would be the graphics. 99% of all scenery and creatures in the game are made of cubes, rectangles, or squares. Even water ripples away from a falling step in squares. Blood pools in squares upon the ground and even the moon and sun appear as cubes in the sky. 

As you move through the game you will eat prey (Or sometimes outfight a predator) To gain new forms and power. The more forms you gain the more wilderness goes back to the land (This wilderness has recently been stolen by a rather nasty Killer cubivore). Naturally it is your goal to dethrone this killer of the wild and set your self up as king of the beast, thus filling the land once again with wilderness.</desc>

		<desc>This is the fourth installment in the Custom Robo series, but the first one to be released outside of Japan. On an unknown planet in the future, custom robos are used for criminal purposes. Those who can manipulate the robots through brain waves are called "Commanders". When you and your comrades learn of a strong, autonomous maneuvering robot, you decide to investigate the matter.

The game mixes action (fighting), simulation (assembling) and RPG elements (do some detective work to unravel the mystery) in a single game. You can construct your own robot with over 200 parts, including over 50 guns, 30 bombs, 30 pods and 15 legs. In a typical arena match, you have to fight real-time battles and victory means you can acquire new parts and continue with the storyline. As there are different kinds of battles (two-on-two, tag team, four-player battle royale), you have to use different strategies and make use of the obstacles in the arena.</desc>

		<desc>The military has mysteriously closed the summit of Mt. Garrick, and Chief O'Leary is trying desperately to drive snowboarders off the mountain.

Dark Summit is a twist on the snowboarding genre.  Instead of trying to pull off insane tricks, you'll be completing various missions, such as "Find the Bomb" and "Destroy the Cannon".  Pulling off tricks earns you points to buy new equipment.</desc>

		<name>Darkened Skye</name>
		<desc>The Skittles brand candies "Taste the Rainbow" ad campaign is the inspiration behind this action adventure game in which the tasty, brightly-colored orbs are transformed into magical spheres with tremendous powers.

You play Skye of Lynlora, a "sexy Warrior-Hero-Adventurer-Goddess with a smart mouth" whose mundane life as a Dwentil shepherdess is changed forever when she comes upon one of the magical Skittles while following a stray dwentil.  It is up to Skye to reassemble the Great Rainbow which has been squelched by the evil Lord Necroth.  Armed with her sense of humor and trusty staff, harness the power of the Skittles to defeat Necrothâs minions, solve ancient mysteries and ultimately save the world.

As the witty, and often sarcastic, Skye, youâll be running, jumping and battling your way across graphically beautiful, medieval lands depicted in 3-dimensional detail.  The story and plot unfold gradually as you meet numerous, unique non-player characters and solve many puzzles along the way.</desc>

		<name>Army Men: Sarge's War</name>
		<desc>Global Star Software, who picked up the license to the popular ARMY MEN series from 3DO, brings fans of the little plastic soldiers ARMY MEN: Sarge's War for the Gamecube. Following the character of Sarge, a war-scarred veteran, gamers must stop a renegade sect of the Tan Army before they can derail the signing of a peace treaty between the Green and Tan armies. A third-person perspective shooter game, Sarge's War is an easy game to pick up but a difficult one to master. The levels get progressively harder, with Sarge facing waves of enemies at a time. Fortunately, the game has a target lock feature, so Sarge can pick off his enemies one at a time. Some levels require Sarge to destroy walls, fences, or enemy artillery, and in other levels, he takes command of turret gun to wreak some major damage. In addition to the single-player campaign, ARMY MEN: Sarge's War contains several multiplayer modes, including death match, capture the flag, and team advance. Fans of the ARMY MEN series will be glad to see it continued with ARMY MEN: Sarge's War. Players who have fond memories of waging war with the little plastic army men or enjoy third-person shooters will also find Sarge's War a fun, entertaining game to pick up.</desc>

		<name>Baten Kaitos Origins</name>
		<desc>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands.

The main character of the story is Sagi, a "Spirit-born" individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

		<name>Def Jam Vendetta</name>
		<desc>The unlikely combination of Def Jam recording artists and underground wrestling is the subject of this Electronic Arts release, which features the 3D likenesses of such musicians as Ludacris, Redman, DMX, Scarface, Ghostface Killa, Method Man, and more as playable characters. Developed by AKI Corporation, whose previous experience in the genre includes titles WWF No Mercy and WCW/NWO Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta offers an estimated 1,500 animations for each of the 45 included characters. A total of ten different venues are available, and one of the featured modes offers a storyline complete with soap opera-style drama to go along with the suplexes and body slams. Up to four players can compete in Single, Tag-Team, Handicap, or Battle Royale matches.

EA combines the game-making prowess of Aki and the boisterous characters from hip-hop's Def Jam Records. The result is Def Jam Vendetta, a curious concoction that just might have the goods to attract hardcore and mainstream gamers alike. The game features 12 Def Jam artists including Redman, Method Man, Ludacris, DMX, N.O.R.E., and Scarface. As you make your way through the game, you'll be able to unlock all 45 characters plus aditional venues, girls, and concept art.</desc>

Here, the trick system is far simpler as there's no balance meter and most tricks require fewer buttons.  Each level has a set of goals that must be accomplished in order to progress, such as a high score goal, knocking over objects or completing a checkpoint race.</desc>

		<desc>Activision's popular CABELA series is great for hunters in the off-season, and the 2006 entry in the series, CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 for the Game Cube, offers yet another great adventure in the outdoors. As usual, players will be traveling the world looking for the biggest and most dangerous game, which includes wolves, cougars, bears, and even polar bears. This time, the game takes players through Australia, Africa, Alaska, and even to the frozen tundra of Siberia as they stalk the most wanted game. Players will have several options when it comes to choosing guns, bullets, and other accessories. Animal calls, traps, decoys, and bait are all available for sell and use in the wild. As players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds, however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting games are always great, and CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 is no exception. Gamers looking for the next big challenge in virtual hunting won't be disappointed.</desc>

		<name>Dead To Rights</name>
		<desc>Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out.  You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City.  On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father.  Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law.

Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate.

Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word.  When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion.  When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform "disarm" moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker.  Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress.

A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack's best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog.  Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow's jaws.

Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of "Bullet-Time" from Max Payne.  You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.</desc>

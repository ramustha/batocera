		<path>./BMX XXX (USA).nkit.gcz</path>
		<name>Bmx Xxx</name>
		<desc>Slightly unusual for a tricks/stunt game, BMX XXX adds a twist to its genre by employing themes involving foul language, nudity and toilet humour.

The "Hardcore Tour" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.

Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. 

There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Generation</name>
		<desc>Bomberman returns with a new cel-shaded 3D look. The same storyline applies, however. Bomberman has been given the task of taking back a powerful element of magic, and protecting it from the hands of evil. To do so, he must use his bombing abilites to blast his way through mazes filled with crazy enemies and hidden secrets. There are 5 worlds in all, each with 16 levels to complete. And after completing cetain objectives and picking up items, Bomberman will learn new techniques and abilities to improve his range with his bombs or use new weapons.

Also included is a 4 player classic bomberman multi-player modes. Unlike the adventure mode, all of the multi-player modes are set in the original 2D, top down style perspective. The last man standing wins in most rounds, with the added twist of other enemies on screen and timed battles.</desc>

		<name>Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO : Millionaire Fighting 2001</name>
		<desc>Capcom VS SNK 2 is composed almost entirely of classic Street Fighter and SNK fighting techniques, which means lots of charge moves, half and quarter circles, and super moves. What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Hominid (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Alien Hominid</name>
		<desc>You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.

The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</desc>

The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. 

The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</desc>

		<name>Batman Begins</name>
		<desc>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.

Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.

Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.

You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil is an action-adventure game with diverse game play. Most of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.</desc>

		<desc>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.

Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</desc>

Your goal is to stop the Hige Hige Bandits who plan to destroy Planet Bomber by crashing an artificial comet, Dark Star, into it. In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure.

Jetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature which keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action.

There are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.</desc>

		<desc>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series.  In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter."  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

		<desc>Activision's popular CABELA series is great for hunters in the off-season, and the 2006 entry in the series, CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 for the Game Cube, offers yet another great adventure in the outdoors. As usual, players will be traveling the world looking for the biggest and most dangerous game, which includes wolves, cougars, bears, and even polar bears. This time, the game takes players through Australia, Africa, Alaska, and even to the frozen tundra of Siberia as they stalk the most wanted game. Players will have several options when it comes to choosing guns, bullets, and other accessories. Animal calls, traps, decoys, and bait are all available for sell and use in the wild. As players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds, however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting games are always great, and CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 is no exception. Gamers looking for the next big challenge in virtual hunting won't be disappointed.</desc>

What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Taxi</name>
		<desc>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. 

In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.

Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</desc>

		<name>Cubivore</name>
		<desc>Cubivore is a "Call of the Wild" brought to an interactive media. Gento Matsumotos serene and surreal portrait of wilderness lost then civilization reverting (or progressing) to wilderness. The music though not long is of high quality and presents eerie and beautiful pieces. 
Of course the most obvious thing about Cubivore would be the graphics. 99% of all scenery and creatures in the game are made of cubes, rectangles, or squares. Even water ripples away from a falling step in squares. Blood pools in squares upon the ground and even the moon and sun appear as cubes in the sky. 

As you move through the game you will eat prey (Or sometimes outfight a predator) To gain new forms and power. The more forms you gain the more wilderness goes back to the land (This wilderness has recently been stolen by a rather nasty Killer cubivore). Naturally it is your goal to dethrone this killer of the wild and set your self up as king of the beast, thus filling the land once again with wilderness.</desc>

		<name>Custom Robo</name>
		<desc>This is the fourth installment in the Custom Robo series, but the first one to be released outside of Japan. On an unknown planet in the future, custom robos are used for criminal purposes. Those who can manipulate the robots through brain waves are called "Commanders". When you and your comrades learn of a strong, autonomous maneuvering robot, you decide to investigate the matter.

The game mixes action (fighting), simulation (assembling) and RPG elements (do some detective work to unravel the mystery) in a single game. You can construct your own robot with over 200 parts, including over 50 guns, 30 bombs, 30 pods and 15 legs. In a typical arena match, you have to fight real-time battles and victory means you can acquire new parts and continue with the storyline. As there are different kinds of battles (two-on-two, tag team, four-player battle royale), you have to use different strategies and make use of the obstacles in the arena.</desc>

You play Skye of Lynlora, a "sexy Warrior-Hero-Adventurer-Goddess with a smart mouth" whose mundane life as a Dwentil shepherdess is changed forever when she comes upon one of the magical Skittles while following a stray dwentil.  It is up to Skye to reassemble the Great Rainbow which has been squelched by the evil Lord Necroth.

		<name>Dead To Rights</name>
		<desc>Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out.  You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City.  On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father.  Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law.

Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate.

Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word.  When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion.  When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform "disarm" moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker.  Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress.

A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack's best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog.  Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow's jaws.

Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of "Bullet-Time" from Max Payne.  You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.</desc>

Developed by AKI Corporation, whose previous experience in the genre includes titles WWF No Mercy and WCW/NWO Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta offers an estimated 1,500 animations for each of the 45 included characters. A total of ten different venues are available, and one of the featured modes offers a storyline complete with soap opera-style drama to go along with the suplexes and body slams. Up to four players can compete in Single, Tag-Team, Handicap, or Battle Royale matches.

EA combines the game-making prowess of Aki and the boisterous characters from hip-hop's Def Jam Records. The result is Def Jam Vendetta, a curious concoction that just might have the goods to attract hardcore and mainstream gamers alike. The game features 12 Def Jam artists including Redman, Method Man, Ludacris, DMX, N.O.R.E., and Scarface. As you make your way through the game, you'll be able to unlock all 45 characters plus aditional venues, girls, and concept art.</desc>

		<name>Baten Kaitos Origins</name>
		<desc>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands.

The main character of the story is Sagi, a "Spirit-born" individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On the first level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are eight different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal.

Previously released on Famicom (Japan-only), Super Famicom (Japan-only), and Game Boy Advance, Fire Emblem leaves the 2D overhead maps of old behind to serve up 3D villages, fields, and caves, and polygonal battle sequences. The continent of Tellius is divided into humans and half-man/half-beast demi-humans. These two races have battled for centuries and only recently established an uneasy peace. Now, a new force threatens to tear apart the seven kingdoms and reignite the flames of war. Joining the Fire Emblem ranks are new units, such as such as the shape-shifting laguz who transform into beasts to attack their foes. Additionally, characters can now learn unique skills as they gain experience, giving players even more ways to customize their strategy.</desc>

		<desc>Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing.  This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks.  There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first.  The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total.

The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks.  You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way.  Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion.  If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.

Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</desc>

		<desc>The reality you know is under threat.

                The reality you know has been infected with a retroactive virus capable of rewriting history in its own image. The reality you know must end in order to save it.

                At an indeterminable point in mankind's future, ordered society has reverted to a feudal state, scattered groups of survivors huddling together in small villages and nomadic enclaves. Mankind is running scared of the greatest to it's existence since reality first sputtered into existence.

                Decades ago, the face of the planet changed, entire cities disappeared overnight, whole countries vanished. Left in their place were creatures, hideous shambling monstrosities, technologically advance, and yet intellectually retarded. And as mankind would soon discover, this was an enemy that could not be stopped and killed. Strike one down, and it would be reborn without so much as a scratch.

                In the dark years ahead, when our enemies are but warped reflections of ourselves, and where our allies may be more than they seem, a boy, his sister, and a rag-tag assembly of unlikely warriors are the planets last hope. But as they soon discover, immortality comes at a price. Twisting perceptions, time and emotions.

                Future Tactics is a tale of love, loss, hope...and some mean green ugly muthas.

                Features:
                * Nine beautifully crafted characters, each with unique weapons and attributes
                * Nineteen levels, each with varied landscapes and challenges from rural idylls to deserted cities complete with seasons
                * High explosive action combined with turn based strategy allows the player to choose the pace of progress
                * Advanced AI enemies that respond intelligently to your every move
                * Unlimited replay opportunities as the combination of a unique enemy AI and deformable landscapes means that no two games are ever the same
                * Compelling plot driven missions written by TV script writer Paul Rose (of East enders fame) complete with rich FMV story driven objectives at the beginning of each mission
                * Fully destructible landscapes, buildings and scenery.
                * Enjoy the story-driven campaign or challenge a friend for a thrilling duell!</desc>

John becomes a part of one of those experiments, and his spirit is separated from his body. As a ghost, he must possess other beings to find out what happened to his body. John has to find his body before it perishes.

Players start the game as John Raimi in human form. The game plays as though it is a regular first-person shooter. Players in human form can strafe, aim, run, and shoot enemies. In spirit form, they must possess people or animals to keep from being pulled into the afterlife; they can also drain the life from plants. To possess a being, first players have to frighten it. Players achieve this by possessing objects in the environment and making them do strange things.</desc>

		<desc>Among animation studios a link exists to a realm known as the "Toon World". This world is inhabited by, of course, cartoons. Filming is done in the toon world and then sent to the real world for editing and production, thus reducing the tedium and cost of animation. However the animation industry is under heavy pressure from new computer generated techniques of animating. In an effort to revitalize traditional Cel animation the real world Studio SPUMCO will be creating a cartoon based on Extreme Skating. And so auditions begin in the Toon World.

The cast of characters are all Cel-Shaded and mostly anthropomorphisms. You will control one of them through eight large sets to try and be selected for the cartoon. You collect points by doing what you would do in any skateboarding game, grinding, jumping, the usual ticks. However,  here there is a twist. Seeing as you are a cartoon you can gain points by being beheaded crushed and other familiar animated antics. Sometimes a level will consist of a battle or a race.

The game also contains a two player versus mode.</desc>

		<name>Mario Party 6</name>
		<desc>Mario Party 6 builds upon the style and mechanics of its predecessors by offering furious four-player fun rooted in board game mechanics. The new additions in Mario Party 6 include day and night cycles, new characters and mini-games, and of course, the new microphone. Two of the new characters, named Brighton (a sun) and Twila (a crescent moon) get into a heated debate over who's better. The dispute creates a day/night dichotomy that comes into play whenever playing on any of the six game boards. When you're ready to play, a pop-up book springs open and highlights your options. Party Mode is where you'll find the different board games, which you can play solo or with friends. Instead of just collecting stars, though, each board features different objectives. Mario Party 6 features over 80 different mini-games.</desc>

		<name>Mario Superstar Baseball</name>
		<desc>Mario and friends are challenged to play baseball with Bowser. So they play ball games with each other to decide who should play Bowser. The rules are the same as any other baseball game with some exceptions. Like other baseball games, each team gets three strikes, three outs, and four balls per inning. However, you can choose to play less than nine innings. You can also choose from Exhibition, Challenge, Toy Field, and Minigame modes. Exhibition mode is one game between two teams. In Challenge mode, you choose a team to play every other team; you can get the other teams characters by completing certain challenges. When you beat the other teams, you get a chance to play Bowser's team. In Toy Field mode, up to four players take turns to get the most points; players receive points by hitting the ball at certain spots, which consist of out, 1-, 2-, or 3-hits, or homerun spots. You can get a turn by catching the ball when your opponent hits the ball. At the start of Exhibition and Challenge modes, you choose your team captain. In Exhibition mode, you also choose team members, but in Challenge mode, your team members depend on which captain you pick.

All the team captains have star pitches and star hits. The characters can also pitch fastballs and change-ups. You can unlock more characters through Challenge mode.</desc>

		<name>Nfl Street 2</name>
		<desc>NFL Street 2 is the second game in EA's arcade football series. Players try to become the world's best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes.

Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots.

There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament.

Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06.

The PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer: Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and  Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes. Up to four players can play on a single PSP in the Party Play game modes such as the 2 Minute Challenge and Jump Ball Challenge.</desc>

		<name>NHL 06</name>
		<desc>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features.

Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.

With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.

All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.

The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</desc>

You can draft new players, sign free agents, make trades with other teams, and retire old players. Statistics are kept throughout the life of a franchise in several categories.

Also new this year is the use of the right analog stick to execute manual dekes and slip the puck past the goalkeeper.</desc>

		<desc>The "best selling pro hockey franchise" is back with the 2004 edition, and it's loaded with more.

Like Madden NFL 2004, NHL 2004 has a deep career mode, titled Dynasty Mode.  You take on the role of GM for up to twenty seasons.  As GM, you'll have to negotiate contracts, conduct drafts, make trades, sign free agents, make sure your players are getting the training they need, and more.  If you're good enough, you may make it into the GM Hall of Fame.

Besides Dynasty mode, you've got the basic game modes; Season, Exhibition, and Playoffs.

The control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games.  Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button.

NHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights.  The right analog stick controls "Bruise Control", which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions.  Before you get into fights, you'll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in.  Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check.

NHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game.  Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in NASCAR Thunder 2004) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums.  This feature isn't found on the PC version.

In addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany's DEL or Sweden's Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars.

The PlayStation version of NHL 2004 supports online play.</desc>

Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.  The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man Fever</name>
		<desc>Pac-Man Fever takes place again!  This time, Pac-Man is throwing a party, and has invited his other Namco friends to join in the activities.  Players can choose for the six following characters:

Pac-Man (from Pac-Man), Ms. Pac-Man (from Ms. Pac-Man), Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken), Tiger Jackson (from Tekken), Astaroth (from Soul Calibur), and Reiko (from Ridge Racer).

Gameplay is similar to Nintendo's Mario Party, in which each player competes in a set of mini-games to advance around the board of three various worlds (Medieval, Space and Tropical).

Players set the length of the game (short, medium, long), and play in rounds.  Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two-player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets. 

With "Store" tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens.

Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game.  Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score.</desc>

		<desc>Pac Man is back this time under the direction of famous Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (The man behind Zelda, Mario etc.) 

In this game one person plays as the famous Pac Man while the other players take the role of the ghosts desperately trying to stop the yellow menace from eating his way to a predetermined score. 

Now the twist is Pac Man sees the game from the classic Pac Man view on the Game Boy Advance while to ghosts each have a limited view of the area in 3D on the television screen. Teamwork becomes vital as they try to hunt down Pac Man, the ghost who eats Pac Man then gets the Game Boy Advance and tries his luck as the hunted.

If Four players are not available computers will act as any ghost not directly controlled by a player. Computer ghost can not hurt Pac Man unless they have been touched by a human controlled ghost. Which ever human player touches them first will get control of the game boy if the computer catches Pac Man.</desc>

Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that's Pac-Man.

Using his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.

The game also features four classic Pac-Man games to unlock, all taken from different Namco compilations. They are, in order of appearance:

The setup results in an experience that approaches perpetual carnage, and it's all paced along and broken apart by some witty banter, too.

		<desc>Mystic Heroes is a fighting game loosely based on the novel Fengshen Yanyi (16th century). The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks. 

During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep his abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the story there is also a Survival mode.</desc>

		<name>NHL Hitz Pro</name>
		<desc>NHL Hitz Pro is Midway's 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.

As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</desc>

		<path>./Odama (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Odama</name>
		<desc>Odama is a quirky pinball title set in ancient Japan.  You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination.

The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission.

Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today's standards.  In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan.  It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal.  Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles.

The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers.  It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time.  When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission.  In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game.  Using these commands, you'll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways.  For example, by saying, "press forward," your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers.  These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success.

However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar.  When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.

There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you.  Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over.

In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.</desc>

Now, a group of youngsters are searching for the Rave Stones, but of course, things are never as easy as they might seem...

Based on the manga and anime series created by Hiro Mashima, Rave Master is an action fighting game not unlike Power Stone or Poy Poy. Up to four players fight in an enclosed arena using various attacks and abilities. During battles, weapons will appear which can be picked up and used. Items called Rave Stones and Shadow Stones also appear, which will grant special abilities to the player who picks them up. Twelve characters from the anime and manga are available to play as.

There are several modes of play, including story mode, where you choose one of five characters and play through their story; VS mode, where up to four players fight with various kinds of rules; and free mode, where the goal is to survive through a series of stages.</desc>

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.

As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.

As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.

Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</desc>

Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out.

You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival.

The game is largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.</desc>

		<desc>Even though Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were able to destroy the Umbrella corporation's undead monsters in the original Resident Evil, Umbrella's experiments with the T-virus continued unhindered. Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated and trapped inside the city by a car crash. Seeking refuge within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil 4</name>
		<desc>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.

Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. 

The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.

The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</desc>

30 missions are on offer with various objectives (destroy other cars, kill citizens and build alliances with other clans), with your ultimate goal being the leader of the gang that everyone fears.
Weapons and upgrades keep your car ahead of the pack, but to do so you need to search out the parts. Scavenger hunts for blueprints is the only way to do so, building the ultimate weapons while improving the speed and reliability of your machine.</desc>

		<name>Skies of Arcadia Legends</name>
		<desc>Enhanced port of the Dreamcast RPG, offering a mix of real-time exploration and turn-based battle sequences. Like the RPGs of old, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, the basic idea is to send a player out into the world to slay groups of enemies, gain experience, buy weapons and items, and accomplish something grand. As lead character Vyse and his trusty female sidekick, Aika, you dock one of the evil Valuan's ships to take it over and grab some loot. As members of the Blue Rogues -- pirates that in Robin Hood fashion give to the poor and steal from the corrupted rich -- it's your whole life. In the process, you stumble into more than you bargained for. The actual gameplay itself revolves around several different devices: turn-based ground and air battles, airship-to-airship duels, and real-time 3D exploration.</desc>

		<desc>Based off the sequel to the popular 2002 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 2 once again places the player in the Web-Swinger's tights as he goes up against Dr. Octopus in this 3D adventure game.  

Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.  

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</desc>

Unlike the previous two entries in the series, you must venture around the mountain, completely free to do what you wish, in order to find challenges and races to compete in.

There are a variety of events to compete in, from your usual all-on-all race through courses, scattered with obstacles and huge jumps to perform wacky tricks, plus there's a half pipe to bust tricks, and there's plenty of challenging tricks to master, and items to grind to gain bonuses. Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races.

With challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.</desc>

With improved controls making "Monster Jumps" (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won't get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled "black-diamond-dominating rockstar".

The game promises big jumps, fast pace and lots of coloured, detailed slopes.

The GameCube version delivers Mario, Luigi and Peaches on the slopes as special characters. Each has their own moves and is accompanied by Mario-style music.</desc>

		<desc>SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. 

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</desc>

		<name>Puyo Pop Fever</name>
		<desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

		<path>./Resident Evil 4 (USA) (Disc 2).iso</path>
		<name>Resident Evil 4</name>
		<desc>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.

Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. 

The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.

The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</desc>

Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board's "fuel" source is air. You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well you'll have to use another means of replenishment: performing tricks with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence from racers who are in front of you.</desc>

		<desc>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf series".

The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple bogey.

One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.

All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.

Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.

Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles.

		<name>Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2004</name>
		<desc>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf series".

The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple bogey.

One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.

All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.

Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.

Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004.  This feature isn't on the PC version.

		<desc>Trigger Man is an action game where the main protagonist Trigger Man works for the Coladangelo Family, who is on the brink of a mafia-style war with the rival Montagano Family, which believes Don Coladangelo is responsible of the death of their Don's son. Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family.

Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total.

There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</desc>

		<desc>When 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically altered spider he became faster, stronger, more agile and gained the spider-like ability to cling to walls.  Add web shooters and a costume and Peter becomes Spider-Man.  Eddie Brock, Jr. is Peter’s childhood friend.  In search of his scientist father’s legacy, Eddie came in contact with a symbiotic suit which transformed him into the monstrous Venom.  Ultimate Spider-Man follows both their Brian Michael Bendis-scripted adventures, as Spidey attempts to prevent Venom from killing innocents while Venom seeks to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D.’s machinations.

The Ultimate version of the Spider-Man mythos revamps the franchise, bringing in edgier (and often younger) versions of famous superheroes and supervillains.  The Human Torch, Wolverine, Electro, and Green Goblin are some of the Ultimate characters who make appearances.  Ultimate Spider-Man features a fully rendered, cel-shaded Manhattan open to exploration.  

With few exceptions, Spider-Man and Venom can explore Manhattan and Queens, climbing, jumping, and web swinging away.  Story missions show up as hot spots on the map as do other in-game objectives.  When the player is done patrolling (or destroying) the city, they can hit these hot spots to advance the story.  Between story missions, Spider-Man and Venom can follow race paths, go on combat tours, discover and collect hidden icons, and help (or hurt) the citizens of New York.</desc>

The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape.

Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</desc>

The main goal of the game is still the same, to burst the bubbles, however this time instead of featuring little and cute dinosaurs, Worms Blast introduces battle-hardened worms or explosive sheep angry for points, battling up on boats.

Fortunately, Worms Blast is not just a mere copycat of Puzzle Bobble with cell-shaded graphics. Team 17 have made numerous changes to the gameplay, which make playing the game quite a different experience.
Along others, these change include the ability to actually move your character or to shoot on the other player, different kinds of weapons and a load of varied gameplay modes. The main change to the game is probably the fact that you're no longer firing bubbles, but missiles that color them on impact.</desc>

		<name>Xiii</name>
		<desc>XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum's book 'The Bourne Identity' and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. You must be damn important, because everyone is trying to kill you. As you progress, you learn more about your secret agent past and your curious name, XIII.

You unravel clues behind a conspiracy of epic proportions in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions such as head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, XIII has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than 15 weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and a whole load of baddies in levels all over the world. During the game, you can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.</desc>

The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</desc>

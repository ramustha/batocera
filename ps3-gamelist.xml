		<desc>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Brings the GTA world to the early 90s in this huge California-based installment. Deal with rival gangs and corrupt cops as you climb the crime ladder.

Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.</desc>

		<desc>CAUGHT IN A GLOBAL CONFLICT

Battlefield 4 puts you in the boots of US Marine Sgt. Daniel Recker, member of the Tombstone squad. Against the backdrop of a global conflict between US, Russia and China, you'll engage in combat on foot and by operating land, sea and air units. 

Thankfully, you're not alone in your struggles on the Battlefield. The bonds with your teammates will grow stronger as you face perils of every kind. Don't let your squad down; they're counting on you as much as you need them to survive.

In Battlefield 4 you'll engage in both close quarters squad-based combat and in vast battles commandeering tanks, jeeps, jets, helicopters and naval units. Utilize high-tech gadgets, a wide variety of weapons, and the dynamic environment itself as the climactic story progresses.

Battlefield 4 takes the fight to many urban environments like the outskirts of Baku and the skyscrapers of Shanghai, all of which become explosive, dynamic playgrounds for the Tombstone Squad.

Whether you're riding the waves of the South China Sea or traversing Shanghai's iconic Huangpu River, naval warfare is central in Battlefield 4's single player campaign.

Fight on huge fields, massive industrial areas, or in enemy air space. Nothing compares to the scale and scope of Battlefield 4.</desc>

Continuing right after the events of God of War II, Kratos, the fallen god and spartan warrior, finds himself riding on the back of the Titan Gaia toward Mt. Olympus. Betrayed and killed by his father and ruler of Olympus, Zeus, to give up his power, Kratos returns from the Underworld and decides that he will bring about the death of Zeus by any means necessary. Knowing that the battle against the Olympians would not be easy, he enlists the help of the Titans, the former Elder Gods overthrown by Zeus and his brothers, to help exact revenge. With nothing much to live for, Kratos will stop at nothing to bring chaos to all of Olympus.</desc>

		<name>The Last of Us</name>
		<desc>It has been 20 years since a special strain of cordyceps fungus emerged and began infecting humans, systematically taking over their brains and turning them into The Infected. Since then, the United States military, or what's left of it, has placed much of the country under martial law, establishing Quarantine Zones in many major cities. Each zone features numerous checkpoints where civilians are scanned and tested for infection; any survivor found with even the slightest trace of the disease is euthanized on site. Outside the quarantine zones, nature has reclaimed much of the land lost to humans in recent centuries, resulting in startling contrasts of green and gray in America's abandoned cities.

Joel, a smuggler within a quarantine zone in Boston, sells weapons and drugs on the black market, often trading in ration cards for goods, supplies, or favors. An event occurs where Joel promises a lifelong friend that he will take care of a young girl named Ellie as they escape from the quarantine zone and go across the country in search of the Fireflies, an organization aimed at restoring modern society and finding a cure for the disease without the help of the surviving U.S. government.

On the road, there are scavengers, hunters, and other dangerous survivors looking to exploit the weak and naive to better their own situations; many groups see Joel and Ellie as an opportunity. The pair must constantly do battle with these groups, as well as hordes of the Infected, as they make their way across the country to the Fireflies.</desc>

		<desc>The storyline of Watch Dogs game is built around the concept of information warfare, data being interconnected, and the world's increasing use of technology?questioning who exactly runs the computers they depend on. The game is set in an alternate reality version of Chicago, Illinois, which is one of many cities to feature a supercomputer known as a "CtOS" (Central Operating System). The system controls almost every piece of technology in the city, and contains information on all of the city's residents and activities which can be used for various purposes. In the game's universe, the Northeast blackout of 2003 was found to be caused by a hacker, prompting the development of CtOS. The game will follow a man named Aiden Pearce, a highly skilled hacker described as a person who uses both "fists and wits." The gameplay demo shown at E3 2012 depicted Aiden's attempt to assassinate a media mogul named Joseph DeMarco, who had been wrongly acquitted on charges of murder. In a demonstration shown at E3 2013, Pearce helps a fellow hacker named T-Bone escape after he is discovered attempting to steal a motherboard.</desc>

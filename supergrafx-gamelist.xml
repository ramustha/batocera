		<desc>Aldynes: The Mission Code for Rage Crisis, is a Japanese horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up game developed by Produce for the SuperGrafx. The game has a unique option-based combat and features levels with large scaling and parallax scrolling effects. 

Nearing the year 2020, the societies of mankind fall into global depression just as an alien invasion suddenly descends on Earth. The aliens come from a large mechanical planetoid and attack Earth without reason or communication. With all defenses annihilated, the United Nations and NASA create a powerful space fighter known as The Ortega under project name Aldynes. When star space fighter pilot Fox-A was killed in battle; his bereaved girlfriend Hiroko soon discovers Project Aldynes and hijacks one of the ships to seek vengeance.</desc>

		<name>1941 : Counter Attack</name>
		<desc>The SuperGrafx port of Capcom's hit arcade game. The goal is to shoot down enemy airplanes and collect weapon power-ups (POW). The game uses a vitality system instead of life system in which if the player is hit, it loses one point of vitality and the player is destroyed if hit with 0 vitality then the player is given the option to continue. Lightning attacks can be used by pressing the B button which sacrifices a portion of life energy. Player 1 flies the P-38 Lightning and Player 2 the new Mosquito Mk IV. The game shifts from the original Pacific Front setting with that of the Western Front, in the north Atlantic Ocean. 

The game consists of six levels and was the first in the series to introduce a +1 to the high score when Continues are used.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

		<name>Air Zonk</name>
		<desc>The little and bald prehistoric fellow is back and eager to fight once more, but this time no head-kicking nor bare-teeth hill climbing. PC Denjin is a crazy shooter stuffed with wacky and insane action. Our hero character is somehow very different too - this time he is a flying sunglass-wearing cyborg who fights his way through five intense levels. He is also not alone to face the challenges ahead and the army of minions the evil King Droll sends agains him - he is accompanied by new friends, from a massive robot-rocket to a flying mummy and a big and round floating cow. Smilies and power-ups can of course be collected throughout the game and a special and large sunglass-wearing smiley can call one of PC Denjin's friend to the rescue. But this is not all, if he collects the same kind of smiley twice, then they'll both do a mind-blowing mega-fusion. Freaky stuff. On top of being able to use a large selection of weapons, the player can also charge them up at any time by holding the fire button. Wait too long, and PC Denjin over-heats and drops a huge sunglass-wearing purple poo-poo that explodes and causes a fair amount of damage to all nearby enemies.</desc>

As usually, the main occupation is to blast a lot of aliens which approach the player. The available weapons are bombs and a machine gun, both unlimited. Getting hit is a bad idea because it results in death. The player has three lives which can be raised by scoring 20000 points.</desc>

		<name>1941 : Counter Attack</name>
		<desc>The SuperGrafx port of Capcom's hit arcade game. The goal is to shoot down enemy airplanes and collect weapon power-ups (POW). The game uses a vitality system instead of life system in which if the player is hit, it loses one point of vitality and the player is destroyed if hit with 0 vitality then the player is given the option to continue. Lightning attacks can be used by pressing the B button which sacrifices a portion of life energy. Player 1 flies the P-38 Lightning and Player 2 the new Mosquito Mk IV. The game shifts from the original Pacific Front setting with that of the Western Front, in the north Atlantic Ocean. 

The game consists of six levels and was the first in the series to introduce a +1 to the high score when Continues are used.</desc>

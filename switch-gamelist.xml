		<desc>12 orbits doesn't require any prior knowledge, preparation time or additional controllers. Your left and right Joy-Con, or even the touch screen alone, are all you need for any number of players. The only limit is how close you'd like to be together.

12 orbits is colorful, friendly, fun, and sometimes a little chaotic. You will score goals, color spheres, defend your territory and try to grow as long as possible in 4 varied game modes. It's you against all comers, or grouped as teams.

With simple rules and only one button per player, 12 orbits can be taught to anyone in no time. You can set up a new game in a matter of seconds, even for 12 players. And since each round only lasts about 5 minutes, there's always time for another quick match!</desc>

No... the 88 Heroes (plus ten of their friends)!

Prepare to infiltrate Dr. H8's lair with the help of the strangest, dumbest and most pointless superheroes ever! With 88 levels between you and Dr. H8, only 88 seconds to complete each level and the 88-minute Doomsday clock already ticking, lead 98 unique characters – each with their own special abilities – on a platform-hopping, enemy-smashing, danger-dodging mission to save Earth from complete destruction!</desc>

The game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves. You cannot change weapons or transform into other characters as in the previous games, but you can acquire different ranged weapons for additional attacks as well as unlock certain bosses to increase your available characters.</desc>

Wield wild weapons and execute deadly moves—like the powerful Umbran Climax—to take out angels and demons in this breathtaking action game. You can even team up with friends in 2-player online or local wireless co-op fights (additional accessories required; sold separately.)Bayonetta is a butt-kicking, havoc-wreaking witch who wields sweet weapons like pistols, whips, hammers, flamethrowers, and poison bows. But it's not just about brawn—it's also about style. Bayonetta is deadly but sleek, with moves like Witch Time that slows down time itself, and the all-new Umbran Climax—a special magic attack that summons Infernal Demons to devastate enemies.The Bayonetta 2 game also features an online and local wireless 2-player cooperative mode where players bet halos on their performance and work together to amplify their sass, cause destruction, and score some riches.</desc>

		<desc>Bayonetta is a butt-kicking, havoc-wreaking witch, and she'll shoot, whip, slice, and burn angels as she uncovers the truth about her own past. Her weapons and moves are all stylishly over-the-top, but she can also dodge attacks to slow down time, and inflict Torture Attacks on her enemies. This is the prequel to the Bayonetta™ 2 game, and it's every bit as sassy, destructive, and epic as you'd expect. Bayonetta is the fashionable and foxy unholy offspring of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, and she's lost her memory after being asleep at the bottom of a lake for 500 years. Use Wicked Weaves to summon Infernal Demons, dodge enemies' dangerous attacks to slow down time, and punish angels with deadly devices. You can even dress Bayonetta up in four Nintendo-themed costumes—Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Link, and Samus Aran.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 builds on the gameplay introduced in Championship Edition. Players take control of Pac-Man and walk through various mazes to collect pellets while avoiding roaming ghosts. If you collect enough pellets, you will either see a piece of fruit that Pac-Man sends to the nearest maze or a power pellet that you can use to eat ghosts. Unlike in the past, ghosts can now be pushed up to three times in a row before entering an angry state in which touching Pac-Man will lose a life. Players can also use jump fields to jump over parts of a maze and bombs to instantly return to the beginning of a maze. The game has two main modes: Score Attack and Adventure. The Nintendo Switch 'Plus' version also offers a co-op mode.</desc>

		<desc>Quest of Dungeons is a turn-based dungeon crawler game: a roguelike featuring a good old 16-bit, retro artistic look.

An evil Dark Lord has stolen all the light, so your mission is to enter his lair and defeat him.

By playing as either a Warrior, a Wizard, an Assassin or a Shaman, you have to traverse dungeons, defeat enemies and loot everything you can in order to survive. You can learn new skills in Tomes you find along the way and buy/sell items at shops.

The entire game is procedural so you won't find items/enemies in the same place each time you play.</desc>

As the giant beasts march toward death, the last hope is a scavenger named Rex—and Pyra, a living weapon known as a Blade. Can you find the fabled paradise she calls home? Command a group of Blades and lead them to countless strategic victories before the world ends. Each Titan hosts its own distinct cultures, wildlife, and diverse regions to explore. Search the vast open areas and labyrinthine corridors for treasure, secret paths, and creatures to battle and index.

During these escapades you'll get to know a large cast of eclectic characters, including the weaponized life forms known as Blades. Gather these allies, bond with them to increase their power, and utilize their special ARTS to devastate enemies. But to save the world of Alrest, you must first demystify its cloudy past.</desc>

		<desc>Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique "spin" on the shooter genre.

Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique "target and spin" feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.

The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.</desc>

		<desc>The world has changed. Irrevocably and completely. Green parks have been replaced by grey ruins. Colourful meadows have become toxic swamps. Once vibrant lands are now littered with dust, rubble, concrete, and debris.

Most creatures did not survive the Great Change. The survivors faired rather poorly in the immediate aftermath, becoming prey to all manner of predator. However, a lucky few managed to survive even then, to adapt, to thrive, to evolve. Zombillie was one such creature.

Zombillie lived a comfortable life in his humble cave, hunting for meat, and as he hunted, he grew, and grew, and grew. Everything was going relatively well for Zombillie, except for one problem: Zombillie didn't have enough meat!

Help Zombillie reach the legendary meat farm! A long road lies ahead: 90 complex levels full of puzzles and traps. So stand on your feet - all 100 of them - and just ride!</desc>

In the near future, there are two leagues with 6 teams each. Players pick their team, and compete for the championship. As the game progresses, landmines will be set up on the field, and armor can be purchased during games to reinforce players. These unique aspects make for a very different baseball experience!

The "ACA NEOGEO" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.

Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.</desc>

As in the original, the game plays as a standard 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you have to proceed through each stage killing all enemies that cross your path and defeating the stage boss to proceed. New for the sequel is the inclusion of swords as your default weapons, which now feature both high and low attacks, as well as a block move that allows you to parry enemy attacks. Collecting orbs gives you weapon upgrades and energy attacks, as well as the ability to morph into any of the three spirits released in the original which give you a new arsenal of moves and powers.</desc>

		<desc>The weakest monster ever known in gaming history, the "Slime" is finally standing up for its rights!

Slimes are surprisingly versatile - they can use magic, they can multiply, they can use special abilities...but no matter how capable they are, unfortunately, they usually end up bashed into a mush, sometimes not even by the protagonist of the game but by a village commoner!

…Now it's time to change things using the ability "Claim".

With this ability, slimes are able to take control of their opponents' bodies by jumping into their mouths!

Use "Claim" strategically to take over strong enemies and win your battles.

As you fight through the levels, unveil the ambitions of the Slime monster...

This is possibly the most unexpected underdog-hero fantasy simulation RPG you will ever play!</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to ChromaTec's test lab! You're here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They're not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”.

Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.

If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You're the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

That being said, welcome and good luck!</desc>

It is said that there's a powerful treasure deep under the dungeon. In order to return back to their village through the power of the treasure, they decided to face the challenges of the dungeon!

If Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items and her level will be reset. And because the dungeon transforms every time you challenge it, the quests will never be the same. Your courage and growth will be the key to clear the dungeon!</desc>

No current weapons appear to make any impact on the E.B.E. leaving humanity powerless, and on the brink of destruction. However, humanity has now got one last hope for survival in the development of bioarmor which fuses the EBE's body tissue with metal. These are the Special Enhanced A.N.T.I troops who have incorporated this weaponry with remodeling surgery. With the power of the A.N.T.I., humanity for the first time successfully destroys the EBE Baron class. In the wake of this victory, humanity has mounted a large-scale counteroffensive.

		<desc>Fe is a new type of platform adventure where the story is up to you to discover, without handholding, told wordlessly through the discoveries you make during gameplay.

Run, climb and glide your way through a dark Nordic forest and explore its living, breathing ecosystem filled with secrets and mystical creatures.

At the heart of the experience is a tactile, analogue song mechanic that allows you to communicate and speak to every living thing in the forest.

Learn a diverse array of animal cries that allow you to befriend or manipulate any creature - even plants. Have birds guide you, bears fight for you and have plants grow berries that help you overcome the Silent Ones.

Become Fe and discover a world that you will never want to leave.</desc>

This mind has been quiet and calm for many years. But something has changed. New thoughts have started to emerge - taking the shape of nightmarish creatures who spread fear wherever they go. The only hope is for the grumpy Dusty, the mind's former voice of courage, to get back to his old self and help the mind to face its fears.

Join Dusty and his ever-optimistic friend, Piper, on an adventure through the different sides of the mind, solving puzzles to set things straight, beating back the nightmares and seeking to restore the courage that's been lost.</desc>

One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don't remember who you are, or how you got out there… All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.

When you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship's terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and – ultimately – your life.

The worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves.
The worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.</desc>

		<desc>In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players are the “Experts” who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual. But there's a catch: the Experts can't see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out fast!

Rounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud.

Puzzle solving and communication skills and maybe a few friendships will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.</desc>

		<desc>A joyful, casual puzzle game that will tease both your wits and your memory!

You've always dream of flying. Roaming high in the clouds, free from all worries. Just gliding through air like a bird. Unfortunately, you were born as a millipede, and your best chance of launching to the sky is probably in some crows mouth... or is it?
Rumor has it that the local Aviation School is accepting new recruits for a pilot course. Seeing an opportunity to make your dreams come true, you seize the moment and embark on a journey of your life. Your path is full of dangers, mazes and obstructions, but the end goal is more than worth it!

So rise on your feet, all 100 of them, and get going!</desc>

Team up with three other players locally or online in the new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles* in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pokémon known as Dynamax Pokémon. Certain Pokémon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a powerful set of G-Max moves. But there's more to being a champion than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be the Trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you'll encounter newly discovered Pokémon as well as familiar ones that will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! And for another way to level up your Pokémon, assign them Poké Jobs to complete. You can even play with your Pokémon in Pokémon Camp, just for fun!</desc>

Punch Club is a boxing tycoon management game with multiple branching story lines. Your goal is clear, but how you get there depends on whether you want to legitimately climb the rankings, or take the more ridiculous, shady route.

Along the way you'll want to focus your talents. Will you take the Way of the Tiger, the Way of the Turtle, or the Way of the Bear? Your strength, accuracy and agility all depends on whichever Way enlightens your path. Do you have stripes, or flippers?</desc>

		<desc>In the beginning there was a dot, levitating in white nothingness. Eons have passed and nothing has changed, but the power of creation was slowly stirring within the dot. And this is how the adventure begins!

Qbik is a beautifully designed pixel-art puzzle game. Enter the world of Qbik and explore a square land full of brainteasers, puzzles, and riddles traverse all 63 levels and discover the origin story of this square little fella!

But that's not all, folks! Qbik gives you the ability to make your own cave in the Level Editor!

Use every brain cell you have to help Qbik navigate the caves. Dodge deadly traps and use technology in your favor so you can eat every yellow block (hopefully they're gluten free!) and move forward into the unknown!</desc>

		<desc>Daniel was just an average guy. He was a great videogame player, a big fan of sci-fi movies, and a novice RPG player. In the midst of an RPG, he was teleported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for te ride until his delirium comes to an end.

Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though-- the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes.

Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within. While the stage seems set for a typical role-playing adventure, Daniel will soon discover that everything is not what it seems...</desc>

		<desc>Enter the wacky &amp; whimsical world of Uurnog Uurnlimited, where you have only one goal: find your way around the world, and steal all the animals! Why?nnBecause they're adorable, and because video games.

Uurnog Uurnlimited is a delightfully silly 2D platformer inspired by games like Super Mario Bros. 2, Lyle in Cube Sector, and Dyad. Play single-player or co-op, explore the world through its many mysterious doors, solve puzzles and gather the items and animals needed in your Save Room. Careful though — the Save Room also saves your mistakes (urr nurr!)

What else does it have, you ask? Chaotic neutral NPCs that can mess with your game! Algorithmic music that adapts to the gameplay!
It's uurnbelievable! It's uurnexplainable! It's Uurnog Uurnlimited!</desc>

Although this world can be lonely, she is kept company by her friend BOT. It advises her and encourages her to do the tasks she is assigned, although it knows much more than it lets on. In order to survive in this passive yet hostile environment, BOT will give Vesta a real helper – DROID. He may be a bit rough around the edges, but he'll handle physical tasks that would be impossible for a fully grown adult, let alone a little girl. Besides, he is the perfect weapon to defend against the dangers lurking in the remains of this abandoned complex.</desc>

Traverse snake-infested gulches, punch skeletons wearing cowboy hats, grapple with demon cows, and investigate a wide variety of disgusting spittoons. Talk your way out of trouble as a silver-tongued Snake Oiler, plumb the refried mysteries of the cosmos as a wise and subtle Beanslinger, or let your fists do the talking as a fierce Cow Puncher. Explore a vast open world and encounter a colorful cast of characters, some of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of whom are ugly.</desc>

		<name>Wheels Of Aurelia</name>
		<desc>Embark on an immersive road trip through the gritty western coast of Italy during the roaring 1970's. Playing as Lella, a bold, spunky woman, experience the sights and sounds of a tumultuous time in Italy's history while uncovering events from Lella's storied past. Take the road less traveled, while meeting an unpredictable cast of dynamic characters along your journey and making detours along the way. An interactive visual novel based on short moments in time during Lella's travels, each playthrough ends with one of sixteen different endings based on your choices. Travel across the famous “Via Aurelia” and discover a new side of Italy in a thought-provoking game about the road trip, not the destination.</desc>
